Я не міг би змусити Snov.io взагалі добре працювати для мене, але умовна послідовність, яку він може похвалити, має великий потенціал. Мені дуже подобається інструмент маркетингу електронної пошти, який має можливість створювати чудові послідовності подальших дій, але може підбирати домени електронної пошти.

Можна залишитись на рахунку gsuite і поставити поетапно в nethunt. Простіше налаштувати HubSpot. Навчіть мою вау для надсилання електронних листів із шаблонами в чистому полюванні та зробило моє життя набагато легшим. Відповідайте лише на електронні листи, які потребують моєї уваги.

També hem provat Quickmail i Snov.io. Els seguiments automatitzats de Quickmail són fantàstics. No podria aconseguir que Snov.io funcioni bé per a mi, però la seqüenciació condicional de la qual disposa té molt potencial. M'agradaria molt una eina de màrqueting per correu electrònic que pugui crear grans seqüències de seguiment, però que pugui recopilar dominis de correu electrònic.

Algú sap d’alguna eina de màrqueting de correu electrònic amb aquesta capacitat? Utilitzeu nethunt. S'integra amb el compte gsuite. Pot romandre en compte gsuite i posar-se en fases a nethunt. Més fàcil que HubSpot per configurar. Entrena el meu va per enviar correus electrònics de plantilla a la cerca de xarxa i m'ha facilitat la vida.

Olemme kokeillut myös Quickmailia ja Snov.io. Quickmailin automatisoidut seurat ovat fantastisia. En voinut saada Snov.io: ta toimimaan lainkaan minulle, mutta sen ehdollisella sekvensoinnilla on paljon potentiaalia. Pidän todella sähköpostimarkkinointityökalusta, jolla on kyky rakentaa loistavia seurantajaksoja, mutta joka pystyy poimimaan sähköpostiosoitteita. Tarkoitan sillä, että jos lähetän sähköpostia Johnabc.com-sivustolle, mutta saan vastauksen Annabc.com-sivustolta, en halua, että Johnille lähetetään seuranta. Tietääkö kukaan sähköpostimarkkinointityökalusta, jolla on tämä ominaisuus? Käytä nethuntia. Integroituu gsuite-tiliin. Pystyy pysymään gsuite-tilillä ja laittaa vaiheet yhteen. Asennus on helpompaa kuin HubSpot. Koulutin va-postini lähettämään mallisähköposteja verkkometsästyksessä, ja se helpotti elämääni. Vastaa vain sähköposteihin, jotka tarvitsevat huomioni. Kun käytät gmassia, 15% sähköpostit eivät käyneet läpi. Käyttämällä netthuntia todennäköisesti alle 5% ehkä vähemmän. Suuri nettityylien fani yrityksessäni. Onko Nethuntilla samanlaisia \\u200b\\u200bseurantamahdollisuuksia kuin GMassissa? Kiitos, Phil Dwtarbe. Kuulostaa hyvältä. Tarkastelen sitä. Mitä tulee suosikki sähköpostimarkkinointityökaluihini, käytän usein eSputnikia ja Mailchimpiä mainostaakseni verkkokaupan projektejani.
