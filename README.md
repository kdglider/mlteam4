# Advanced Modeling Branch

## General Guidelines for the branch

- Use the `dataset` folder to store the merged data.
- Use the `model_nbs` folder to push the different notebooks you worked on by following this formate:
    `Name_of_the_task[Name_of_the_contributor].ipynb`  

- Use the `assets` folder if you want to store an image used in one of your notebooks.

## General Guidelines for the notebooks

- Comment your code as much as you can
- Use markdown to highlight your findings
- Use tables (pandas dataframes) to store your results
- Use `classification_report` and `F1 measure` (better use: [F1TP, FP, FN](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/computing-the-f1-score.html))
