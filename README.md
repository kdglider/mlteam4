# team4mlproject
STEMAway Team 4 ML Project for June 2020

**NB: Tips** 
- Add all **resources** in **resources folder** according to category (to make it easier for us)
- The **assets folder** is where you put **images** or anything you will need for your notebooks to link to.
- When you commit please remember to add the -m (for message) to tell us what that commit is all about.
- Try to document (comment) your code as much as possible.

Thank you :)
