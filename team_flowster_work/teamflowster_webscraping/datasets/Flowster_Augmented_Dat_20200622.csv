I would definitely do a Google search on this one. You might do better having a cashback card through a bank in your home country (you don’t mention where that is). Or reach out to where you currently have credit cards and see if they are of any help.
I know that years ago when I moved to the US from Canada (I have citizenship in both countries), credit history was the issue. I was able to get a card through a professional association I was a member of (NSPE). But, I was a citizen so I’m not sure that helps.",0,149,2

Where I come from that system (cashback) is yet making baby steps…it was first introduced last year (before last year here virtually nobody knew that such thing exists)…so you can imagine “how far” we came with it.
I called the bank to ask…there is almost nothing for me.You can gain some cashback in certain (local) supermarkets,but only for a limited time (during the summer).And on some gas stations (again,locally).Nothing else 
That’s why I ask if there’s somebody,with experience for cashback cards for non-US…",0,149,2

I do use X-Ray a fair amount.  X-Ray is basically the chrome extension of Blackbox for researching an ASIN page.  Aside from that I also use the Inventory Levels tool in the extension a fair amount as well.

One thing I have picked up for large price lists though, is I will have PC2 give me both current buybox, and 90 day average buybox side by side.  It’s a good way to quickly see if there is price volatility.  I’ll do the same thing with BSR also to see how constant sales have been.",0,157,3

So after a month of negotiations with a brand i finally got exclusivity!!!  So brand has huge problem because Amazon is selling their products and they don’t know how is amazon buying their stuff? and of course amazon as a seller is not follow MAP policy and they would like if i can take control of entire brand on Amazon. This brand has a revenue of around 40,000$ a month.
So my question is how can i stop Amazon of selling their products on brands listings?. Because Brand owners doesn’t know where is Amazon buying their products from.
And is there any sample of how exclusivity should look like ?
Hope some one know answer !

64,How to remove Amazon from listing?,Product Sourcing,['Vendor Relations'],Ivan,"@Ivan This is going to be a tall task.  A lot of the work will need to be done on the manufacturers end.  Manufacturer needs to be sure that distributors know not to sell their products to online retailers.  It will still happen but it’s easier to get people off the listing if they were told they can’t sell online.
Also special labeling can be used for each distribution channel.  A few months after you have applied the labels, buy from Amazon.  Then see what numbers the product has and you’ll know which distribution channel the product came from.
@LizD may have some other tricks as well.",1,144,5
65,How to remove Amazon from listing?,Product Sourcing,['Vendor Relations'],Ivan,"Some distributors will not cooperate with the brands effectively enough to keep Amazon off the listing. So  the first step should be to determine whether their distributor(s) will.
We know brands who have cut off major distributors because they wouldn’t cooperate. Your brand may have to make some tough decisions.
If the distributor will cooperate, they should work with the brand to ensure that all buyers know that products may not be sold on Amazon.
Either way, Amazon often buys under another name. Here are a partial list of Amazon brands, but they may buy under other names as well:

Mitch has the right idea with the special labeling. If a distributor is cooperating, you are still likely to see people buying products from them and illicitly selling on Amazon. Special labeling (or even marking with a black light pen) will help identify where product is being sourced.
There are all sorts of grey market ways Amazon gets their hands on products as well.
As for the exclusivity contract, send me an email and I’ll send you a sample template. Thanks!",1,144,5

69,What do distributors care about?,Product Sourcing,['Sourcing Brand Name Products'],WillCompere,"D.Jin
My background is distribution, so hopefully I can give some info.  The questions truly depends on the size of the distributor.  You have distributors that are small and local all the way up to distributors that do 25-100 Billion annually.  Even with that said all distributors are focused on selling product.  Your typical distributor has slim margins, so they want more volume.  The larger distributors the only true value you can add is sales volume.  Unfortunately until your buying big #s that is not a real value prop.   For the smaller distributor you may be able to add value by helping them get sales volume on new items they bring in or slower items they need sales on.  The very very small distributors may need help in other areas, but the med to big ones just want sales in my experience.
Hopefully that helps a bit.",4,340,4

103,Winning new accounts using trade shows,Product Sourcing,[],Trent-Admin,"Epic day today. We won a new account worth $10K+/mo in gross profit. Only took me two years from the first time I spoke with them until now.
Got a “we are definitely doing business together. I’m firing 2 of my 4 sellers and adding you as soon as they sell through” from another account that should be worth $50K to $80K/mo in revenue.
I also have at least 10 really solid leads and I expect to win 2-3 of them at a minimum. Another 20 leads that will need nurturing.
If I had to guess, within 90 days, our revenue will be up over $100K/mo.
Here’s a few take aways from my time at the conference over the last few days:

Strong selling brands get pitched far more than you can imagine
Some sellers even offer bribes ($10K cash under the table) to get account approval (didn’t work)
Everyone’s pitch sounds the same (we’ll help you remove unauthorized sellers and increase sales)

So how do you break through?

Rapport is the key to creating opportunities and winning accounts. If they don’t like/trust you, you have no chance in hell.
Content plays a role in building trust. Your smile plays a role in generating rapport.
Be persistent. (email & the phone is great for this)
Go after brands that aren’t yet on everybody’s radar screen. Look for brands that are the up and comers.
DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND KNOW WTF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

There is a MOUNTAIN of opportunity in wholesale. There is a never ending supply of new brands. You simply have to hustle your ass off to get/keep them, and to do that, you have to want it REALLY BAD.

109,Existing Ads?,Product Sourcing,['Vendor Relations'],Mitch,"@APlusSeller One easy way to find out is to run a search for the brand name.  Typically, listings will show up in the sponsored product area if ads are being run.
If you are trying to find if a specific listing is being advertised, and it didn’t show up as a sponsored product in the brand search, you will have to run some searches using keywords from the listing.  This doesn’t guarantee you will get an answer though as they may not be winning they keyword(s) at the moment.
Also, if you do an extraction on the storefront using Jungle Scout, a little SP will show up beside the line on the extraction if ads are being run on the listing.  I believe it may only do this for the sponsored products on the page though so it may be redundant information.",0,139,1

The Keepa box is something you’ll naturally just starting peeking at when you open a product page as it is a good source of quick information.  For deep analysis, the data tab of the Keepa box has very useful information such as the 90D Buybox average and 90D average sellers.  If you don’t have a paid account, you can access the data tab about 10 times per month.
How many is used to see inventory levels.  If Keepa says the 90D average sellers number is 2 and there are currently 3 sellers but How Many shows they only have 3 items in stock, you can guess with decent certainty that the seller will not remain on the listing.  Still ask the brand about them though.  Both tools I use daily and would recommend trying the free version and moving to paid if you see fit.

When I receive a reply (regardless of what they say in the reply), I do the following:

Pull the brand summary report on Viral Launch. This tells me the trend in sales volume and average price. I can also quickly see the top products and how many sellers each have.

If I don’t kill the deal at this stage, my next step is:


Look at the Helium10 product listing score for the top 3-4 products. Ideally, I’m going to find listings with a score under 7/10.


Type in the main keywords from the title of each of the top 3-4 listings to see if ads appear for these keywords. Ideally, no ads appear.


If #2 and #3 are in my favor, I’m DEFINITELY going to call this brand because their marketing sucks and so do their current sellers. They just probably don’t realize that yet and it is my job to help them see the light.
When I reach out, I’m asking to schedule a call (online meeting) so I can screenshare and run them through the results of my Brand Pre-Call Research SOP.

I am new to Webs and Flowster (got this through TWF Live). I recently got my first Brand rejection. The answer was not only “no”, but actually a well thought out “no”.
This was their answer - We are not accepting applications from any new Amazon resellers for one primary reason. We already have several major Amazon resellers offering our products on Amazon. Each of them is studying our price list, and looking for opportunities based on our prices. The result is that they are often competing with each other for the for sales on the same products. This has resulted in strong competition between our resellers to have the best price, reducing each’s margins. We do not see the point of adding more competition for the same basket of goods. We get the same sales, but our customers lose margin.”

Tough day and a new challenge for us today. 
We’ve placed several orders with one of our suppliers, in fact, we have a large order enroute to us currently.
Today they contacted us and said that our account has been flagged for selling on Amazon, which is against their distribution policy. They went on to say that they don’t allow anyone to sell on Amazon, and they demanded that we pull all inventory. They said that if we have any more issues, our account with them will be terminated.


When we signed up we were provided with a MAP policy, but no distribution policy (we checked very thoroughly).


We know they currently have other people selling on Amazon, so this may be like a “we don’t want anymore sellers” type of situation.


We haven’t responded yet, because it appears to be a pivotal point in the relationship and we could really use some guidance.
Any tips on overcoming this objection?",8,338,4
195,OUCH! - Current Supplier - Remove Your Inventory,Product Sourcing,[],edsutton,"@MBahe That is definitely a challenging dilemma!
On one hand you don’t want to lose this brand and on the other hand you don’t want the inventory to just sit. My advice would be to first try and understand why the brand doesn’t want to sell on Amazon. This could one of those situations that Trent has always talked about when brands are tired of working with bad Amazon sellers.
You might also want to show them how much in sales they would lose if they stop selling on Amazon and maybe talk about some value adds that you provide.
If nothing works, then you can possibly ask them to provide a one time exception to sell through the inventory. This way you don’t take a loss and can maintain a relationship for the future.

It may be your best chance to get above board and present your value adds.

198,OUCH! - Current Supplier - Remove Your Inventory,Product Sourcing,[],edsutton,"I am not telling you what to do, but if I was in your situation…I would ask my self  “Do I sell on Walmart at present ?

Quietly I might move some current inventory to Walmart and start selling to get a foot in the door,  also  setting up  an alternate selling platform like Ebay and / or GrooveKart / Facebook - just as a worst case impasse back up .”   But that’s more my decision making style, you do what you feel is right.
By all means create a value added evaluation of their product page, product reviews, how they market their products - all to show them added value as far as sales go.  Is there a way to research the inventory being shipped to you and see if UPS or Fedex either one has a budding sales platform you could use ?
What does this company LIKE about 3rd party sellers, and NOT like about 3rd party sellers ?  Research online this companies goals and mission and mission statement, and the directions their philanthropy goes, consider using it as a template for your adding value campaign .  Treat this company and situation like writing a grant request, find out what really makes them tick and not only appeal to that but position your value adding selling methods and treatment of the inventory to flow toward those lines.
Do they have any schools or orphanages or institutions or causes they as a company espouse or contribute to ?    Design a strategy to create value and  SOP’s to detail and reproduce that, and benefit XYZ% those places they espouse or contribute to - IF and only IF so doing does not compromise your own companies mission.  Consider getting reviews and receipts from said places to use copies of in your  value added proposition positioning efforts.
Ask for higher pay grade tutoring on this project and when the dust settles - make it a SOP.  ( to sell copies of & keep and refine for further use.)
You do have a contract with them when they agreed to sell inventory to you ?   Check with an online sale specializing attorney, it seems like once you purchase inventory it becomes yours to do with as you wish.   In all your future purchase contracts stipulate that you reserve the right as a company to choose appropriate selling platforms.

 Mitch:

the most effective ways to convince a brand


@Mitch, I take a little issue with the framing of your question.  The whole art of selling it to not sell anything.  Here is what I mean.  If you listen to any of Trent’s podcasts or watch any of his video’s the key that most people miss when he talks about talking with brands is that he knows he has something the brand needs.  Most people approach brands in the totally opposite mind set.  (ie I need this brand for my business) When you have properly prepared for the call, researched their listings, researched their offline business, know your value proposition, etc you don’t need to sell anything.  Your whole call is about sharing the research that you did on their business.  If a brand does not see your value when you share all this information with them, don;t waste your time “convincing” them to do anything.  Once you convince them to do something once, you will have to continue to “convince” them again and again and again…",11,435,10

I remember read this in January.",11,435,10
230,Brands with a Single Amazon Seller,Product Sourcing,[],MattB,"Good point @MattB.  I battle to frame this correctly based on how well the brand has optimized its distribution channels.  For well optimized brands, it can be tough to show exactly why the brand needs you but there are always areas that could be improved.  Either they will agree that improving in these areas are worth another seller or they won’t.",11,435,10
231,Brands with a Single Amazon Seller,Product Sourcing,[],MattB,"@Mitch if a brand is already optimized you will probably need to get real creative in order to show them you are different than the typical Amazon seller in order for them to be interested in you.

I have spoken with many brand only listrs (i will call them)  Unless they are an APPLE or other high profile brand with a product that requires 100 % control of the distribution chain.

They don’t have systems to they just have BOB manage the amazon thing. (even if they do a good job).  They are small minded because if they thought like NIKE. Kellogg, Ridgid.  They would spend money, create systems and then just focus on making products and letting the sales to others.  (ie walmart)
I say all that to say this.

235,Keeping track of filtered products?,Product Sourcing,['Vendor Management'],Mitch,"Hi @APlusSeller,
If a product continually makes it through the filters when extracting competitors, there isn’t currently a great way to filter it out in the SOPs.  If it meets criteria, it basically slips down to the “Check Your CRM” step before it quits being treated as a newly discovered product.
If you wish to track all products extracted similar to the way competitors are tracked, I would recommend creating another Google worksheet (if you haven’t already).  This worksheet will contain a ton of data after awhile.  There are a few ways to remove duplicates from sheets that I learned from [this article].  If you are a Google Sheet wizard, you may be able to do a vlookup and insert data function from all extractions sheets to know if you are adding a duplicate.  I’ll look into this a bit and see what I can figure out.

236,Keeping track of filtered products?,Product Sourcing,['Vendor Management'],Mitch,"Isn’t the “Check Your CRM” step more for identifying brands and not so much the products? I was just wondering because the SOP does not seem to address that.
I will try filtering them out of a spreadsheet but it does seem unwieldy and rather tedious. Especially since it would have to remove the last entry.
Anyway, thanks for your help.",1,200,3
237,Keeping track of filtered products?,Product Sourcing,['Vendor Management'],Mitch,"@APlusSeller yes, the “Check Your CRM” step is more for identifying the brand but it is also the only step limiting the amount of work you do on the product line in the extraction.
Filtering them out of a spreadsheet may likely be tedious and unwieldy.
One thing I’ve done to filter out duplicates in other sheets involves data validation.  You go to Data ->Data Validation, select the range to validate (ASIN column in this instance), put the criteria to “custom formula is” and enter in “=countif($A$2:A2,A2)=1” if column A is the ASIN.  On invalid data, select reject input.
You might give it a shot if you want to pursue this further.

So I’m ready to bring on my second regular VA. I’ve made up my mind that VAs, in general, will work best to take care of many gruntwork, time-consuming tasks.
However, this VA will do an important task - sourcing. For now, I can’t afford an employee. So, I’m going to use a VA to at least tide me over until I get closer to that point.
But, by early-to-mid next year, I have a good shot at being able to afford an employee. And then I see some people in this forum use VAs full-time to do sourcing.
So, when I can afford an employee to do sourcing, how do I decide to go with an employee or with a VA instead?

368,Request a review,Amazon Specific,[],Mitch,"Hi @liahsidney,
I haven’t used the feature but here is what Amazon has to say about it:

We don’t require you to request reviews because our systems already do that on your behalf at no cost to you. If you would still like to request a review for a specific order, we recommended that you use the Request a review feature on the Order Details page instead of asking the customer via email or Buyer-Seller Messaging.


When you request a review using this feature, we ask for both a product review and seller feedback for the order in the same email. These requests use standardized language and are automatically translated into the customer’s preferred language.


You can use this feature to request reviews once per order between 4 and 30 days after the order delivery date. This ensures that customers receive relevant, recent review requests.

Amazon’s New Request A Review Button 1 is interesting, but I am not entirely sure that it is useful.
Basically, amazon already sends generic automated emails (I am sure you can recall getting a few of them when you purchase things on amazon)
The problem is that they are not personalized and they come straight from amazon.
The good thing is that this button complies with all of amazon’s Terms of service, so you won’t find yourself in trouble with them. There are other tools out there that allow you to automate more personal email to your orders, but then you start getting yourself into a grey area with amazon’s Terms Of Service.

370,Request a review,Amazon Specific,[],Mitch,"@chcsteele9 We actually switched over to the request a review feature.  You can request reviews in bulk using Viral Launch (in WEBS SOPs) or Jungle Scout.
I watched a Viral Launch webinar (tried to find the replay link but couldn’t) that talked about the pros of the request a review button.  Basically, the customer doesn’t have to click any links to leave a product review.  They can leave a review within the follow up.  Also, customers no longer have to leave a written review to give a star rating.  The ease with which customers can leave a review in this strategy has made review rates increase significantly.  Viral Launch used an AirPods listing as an example.  The listing had 3,000 reviews when the request a review feature was implemented in September 2019.  They were at 38,000 reviews and a 4.6 star rating by February.

395,Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC,Amazon Specific,[],carlos_federico_igle,"Hoping someone may know the answer here…
I’m a non US citizen with a US LLC. Currently i’m selling under my own name because in the tax interview it says for single member LLCs, put your own personal name.
However, of course i’d much rather be registered under my LLC name and address.
And if i have a US registered LLC, surely that is a business and US entity that is subject to US taxes?
When i enter “business” rather than “individual” on the form instead and say i’m a US person for tax reasons, it asks what kind of LLC - C-Corp, S-Corp or Partnership, then i can enter my EIN number (My LLC is just a simple single member LLC, no mention of any C-Corp or S-Corp)
Anyone also have an issue with this?  Don’t want to get anything wrong!
Really appreciate any feedback",1,556,16
396,Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC,Amazon Specific,[],carlos_federico_igle,"Disclaimer first: I’m not a US tax accountant or US financial advisor. All I am sharing below is based solely on my own personal experience, and professional advice provided to me. I strongly recommending you always seek independent legal and/or financial advice.
I hope the following helps you better understand the issue so that you can gain a bit more clarity and decide how to move forward.
I too am non US resident and I know exactly what you’re talking about in this scenario.
This is one of the reasons I actually shut down my US single member LLC and established a company in my own country.
Amazon’s tax interview is setup correctly, and does ask the correct questions from a tax perspective.
The issue is however, their system drags across the single member details and uses that same information as the legal entity, thus why your personal name shows up as the legal entity inside of Seller Central.
I escalated this issue on numerous occasions with Amazon and explained the issue even at their legal level, however, despite also having sought clarification through a US based tax attorney, Amazon still said it is setup correctly in their system.
There is no way around it as a single member LLC entity when you’re an international non resident single member.
The biggest issue I could foresee with this is that your vendor issued invoices will always be in the name of the legal entity, your LLC, and so this will never match with Amazon’s backend system.
If Amazon ever asks for invoices for verification, you’ll very likely hit major issues, an unlikely be able to prove anything.
Operating under wholesale business model using that legal structure is risky, especially with the level of frivolous IP and authenticity claims that occur on the platform now.
You’ll also never be able to get ungated if requested to provide invoices because again, the entity details wont’ match. I know this for sure because I experienced and lost money from it.
Also, be aware of the additional reporting requirements that the IRS now has in place for non resident LLCs.
Very few people are aware of these new requirements until it is too late.
There are all very important considerations you should understand when deciding to continue operating as a US entity, and another reason why I would suggest you seek professional advice from someone who specialises in US tax law for NON US residents.
I hope this helps.
All the best.",1,556,16

Thanks very much for your very detailed reply, really appreciate it.
Yes those issues you mentioned i already came across (invoices with my LLC name) but i got around it by asking them to put my own name and address on it, which they were happy to do but that just sounds amateur to most suppliers i’m sure.

398,Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC,Amazon Specific,[],carlos_federico_igle,"Hi,
I’m glad it helped.
Unfortunately it’s another one of the many challenges us internationals experience when starting out on the marketplace in the USA.
Yes I established a new company in my home country and then applied for an EIN, which you will need to sell on the marketplace, and yes, it is very easy to get via a phone call to the IRS.
Then it’s up to you whether you get a reseller certificate.
You don’t need one, however you will find a LOT of brand owners who won’t open an account unless you provide them with one, even when you clearly explain that you’re an entity domiciled outside of the USA so legally don’t need one as I was advised by a tax attorney.
It’s more to remove that as an objection, but it does come with compliance requirements.

Tracking the shipments is explained in the shipping SOPs; specifically the Supplier Inbound Shipment and Create an Inbound Shipment to Amazon SOP.
Overall you may be able to automate much of the reorder process but you need to be very careful.  If your settings are off or you have a sales spike, you can easily place a bad order and have capital tied up in Amazon warehouses for an extended period.

448,Wholesale VS Agency business model?,Amazon Specific,['All Other Amazon Related Issues'],Mitch,"Hello,
This question is directly related to @Trent_Dyrsmid  business model (hope Trent or anyone that has a good answer can reply to this).
When pitching my company business model to other entrepreneurs, specifically referring to the wholesale model that focus on closing special agreements with brands to have exclusive distribution on Amazon, I always get asked whether what I provide is a service or not.
I initially thought it was not but then I realized that working on the same offer but providing it  as a service might be convenient under certain aspects.
In the “traditional” wholesale model, my company would first close an agreement for the exclusivity to be the only seller of those products on Amazon, then I would periodically buy the products from the brand and do as much as I can to improve sales because it will benefit me (improve pics, listing and invest in ppc)
On the other hand, if I would give the same kind of offer to the brand, but offering it as a service, I would manage their Amazon account (still being the only seller as I would represent the brand itself) but this time I won’t need to purchase any stock in advance (as the brand would provide them), and I will not need to invest in any optimization as it’s their account so I can offer that to them as a service. In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock.
I see in the service case (so essentially providing Amazon account management) similar upsides to the “traditional” model (eg. exclusivity) but less downsize (eg. no need to purchase stock in advance)
What are your thoughts about this? Am I missing anything?
My other biggest concern in the “traditional” model is: how do you make sure that the brand won’t end the exclusivity agreement after you have built BSR for their products and invested in PPC and listing optimization?
Or what can you do to minimize that risk?
Thanks in advance",6,215,3
449,Wholesale VS Agency business model?,Amazon Specific,['All Other Amazon Related Issues'],Mitch,"Yes you can absolutely go about it as an account management service.
The biggest upside, as you noted, is you don’t have to use a lot of up front capital.
The biggest downside is that the brand now sees you as very accountable to provide those services.
We’ve found that the accounts where we are sending them checks (buying inventory) are much less headache than when they’re sending us checks (service model).
We do ask brands to sign a contract for 6 mo (which auto renews), but the best way to make sure they won’t end the exclusivity agreement is to do great work for them. We also try not to expend any more capital (subcontractor, labor, etc) towards growing the account than the profit we make from the account. We’re pretty transparent with the brand about this.",6,215,3
450,Wholesale VS Agency business model?,Amazon Specific,['All Other Amazon Related Issues'],Mitch,"Thank you for your answer!
Adding to that, with your model then, do you only look for big brands with strong presence on Amazon? What about those other small-medium brands that might have weak or no presence on Amazon but might be good brands offline? Do you even consider those as your targets?",6,215,3
451,Wholesale VS Agency business model?,Amazon Specific,['All Other Amazon Related Issues'],Mitch,"@gianmeliShanghai  Obviously the big brands are the ones that typically make you profitable but we also look to source small brands as well.  You have to be VERY transparent with them about what you will do for them though.  We typically promise them less and on a more elongated timeline.
You can tell them, we will do X for you after we have reached Y in gross profit.  Y may take 3 months to accumulate but then you’ll have some cash to undertake the first piece of an optimization.

455,How to sell a lead on the idea of product reviews = more sales,Amazon Specific,[],dast1983,"Hey -
So I have a lead I want to approach with the idea of creating automated emails using Feedback Genius to increase their product sales. They’re going to list some items on Amazon, but I don’t think they realize how long it can take to get enough reviews to get their sales flowing.
I want to set up automated emails, customize them to the product, and create a PDF to drive their review rate up to 6-7% using Feedback Genius. I haven’t done this with new listings before, so I’m trying to figure out how to discuss this so it’s set up for win-win from the start.
I’d also offer to monitor and respond to negative reviews for them.
Anywho, I’m thinking of telling them they’ll get a much slower rate of reviews without using automated emails or a PDF, which means if I add those two types of value for them, that will shorten their time to grow sales significantly. And the same with responding to the negative product reviews.
So, do I tell them I expect about a .5% review rate without any emails sent, 2% with a custom email sent, and about 6% if we advertise a bonus PDF? And then hold myself accountable for showing them those metrics with Feedback Genius.
And if they’re convinced, only after they see that value would I ask them to sign a contract.
It’s scary. Haven’t done this before. Just know it works.

So being out of stock of high velocity products will affect brand health more than low velocity products.  I’d recommend typing Brand Health into the search bar in Seller Central to learn more.

Greetings from Amazon Brand Registry Support,
Thank you for contacting us. I am John Daniel and I will be assisting you.
I understand that you would like to add the role of Registered Agent for brand ‘xxxxxxxxxx’ to the account associated with ‘xxxxxxxxx’.
On checking, I see that the email address ‘xxxxxxxxx’ is associated with multiple accounts in our database. Unfortunately, we cannot process role assignment requests for email address that have multiple accounts associated with it.
In order to have access to Brand Registry, we recommend that you create new Brand Registry account using a new email address after which it can be added as a role.

I would highly discourage two sellers running PPC on the same product. This means that for the same keyword you are competing. For example: if seller A and seller B are both bidding on “tooth,” then the cost will be higher per click since there is more competition for the keyword.
I would recommend offering to run PPC on your account using either a percentage of gross profit, or offering to use PPC to lift sales (potentially risking an unprofitable ACOS, but lifting rank/sales/visibility) and splitting the PPC cost with the brand.",11,323,11

If they don’t, you should explain that the listing gaining traffic and visibility from your campaign will help increase both of your sales.
From the sounds of it though, you need to convince them that you can run a more profitable and successful campaign than they can.  Offer to take a look at their advertising statistics.

We are in the process of opening a store front and are not really sure whether to make it niche specific or a general store that can sell health, household, beauty, electronics… the question is how do we go about in making it a general store? don’t brands want you to see niche a specific store? for example a shoe brand would want to see a shoe store or a beauty brand would want see a beauty store, however we are trying to get into multiple profitable categories and want to use the store to open the accounts since most brands require brick and mortar. I remember you mentioning that you will have a store in your new building and I assume you’ll use that to open accounts too! how will you go about in different categories if the store is not niche specific?

I know the question was addressed to Trent, but I will put a little of my feedback out if it helps at all.  I have been on the brand side and on the distribution side in my career.  Being “distributor” has many different meanings and there are distributors of all different sizes depending on the industry etc.
In my experience volume dictates discounts and price not definition.  Typically a distributor gets a better price because they buy in larger volume and sell to other businesses, but with many brand a truck load is a truck load and they will price it the same.  We do not call ourselves a distributor in any way as we do not distribute product to other companies.  Some brands want regional distributors and will then want you to be able to warehouse and sell products to other companies.  This is not a bad model if you’re able to execute it.    At the end of the day if you can purchase significant volume you should be able to negotiate discounts with almost any brand.

We have a couple different inserts we use for different situations and brands.


Brand Story - Tells the history about the brand and some cool images of founders etc.  This has an email address on it also, but not other link info.  Email is just a support email for any problems.


Cross Selling - Images of the other flavors or types we sell of in the same line.  Typically No link, no coupon code etc.  From time to time we do a direct call to action with a link (driving back to Amazon), but not always.  Sometimes we do for new item launches etc.   We realize this does not allow us to always track the ROI but believe it is worth the nominal expense.


Reach out we want to meet you!  This is a card that has some cool social proof / lifestyle photos that highlight a Facebook, Intragram link etc.

I’m new to the platform and I want to thank everyone in advance for your input and insights.
My question: When you begin to sell exclusively for a brand on AMZ – Do they give you permission or license to use their trademark and thus you become the ‘brand owner’ on AMZ? What would you need from the brand in order to clear the hurdles in Brand Registry?",1,169,1

I don’t compete with Amazon much anymore, but when I did I’d look at keepa to see if there was evidence.

576,Long Term Storage Fees,Amazon Specific,['Inventory Management'],Mitch,How are Amazon FBA long term storage fees calculated now?  At the end of last year they changed to applying long term fees monthly for inventory stored for more than 180 days.  Did it change again?,1,122,1
577,Long Term Storage Fees,Amazon Specific,['Inventory Management'],Mitch,"When researching I found that, as of February 15, 2019, long term storage fees are still being applied on the 15th of each month.  The most recent change was to when long term fees begin accruing and the size of the fee.  Inventory for which long term fees are applied was reverted back to anything in storage for more than 365 days.
Long term fees are calculated based on square footage taken up in the warehouse.  The fee is now $6.90 per cubic foot per unit or $0.15 per unit, whichever is greater.  The minimum fee, $0.15, was dropped from $0.50 per unit which is great for small items.
Long term fee timelines for items enrolled in the Small & Light Program were not reverted however.  They begin accruing long term fees after 180 days.  Fees from 181-365 days are $0.25 per unit.  After 365 days, they are charge $0.50 per unit.  Be careful with sending too much inventory into the Small and Light Program.  Since retail price must be less than $15, margins are eaten quickly.

I purchased WEBS and am getting acquainted with the processes. My question is I have a little over 200 product leads I’ve scouted, have passed the 21-point checklist, and have email contacts or webform links to start contacting in my TWF Scouting & Sourcing Spreadsheet. I would like to upload this information to HubSpot to start sending out emails. I have set my Contact Properties and Data Fields up in HubSpot according to WEBS setup. Do I transfer the info from TWF Spreadsheet into the fields of the WEBS Master Import Sheet or the Product Extraction Sheet and then upload to HubSpot?
If not, is there a more efficient way of doing this that gets the same result?

You would transfer that data into a Product Extraction Sheet.  I’m not sure what all data is in the TWF Scouting & Sourcing Spreadsheet so it may be a little funky but I’m sure there is some data crossover between what the two spreadsheets find important.
As far as overall strategy, think of the Master Import Spreadsheet as your directory for imports.  You will only have one copy of this.  You will have many copies of the Product Extraction Sheet.  One for each extraction you do and each one will be recorded in the Master Import Spreadsheet.",0,152,3

I saw a diagram that illustrates the workflow for the whole (WEBS) system. Does there happen to be a diagram (or something similar) that shows the sourcing workflow? Just how you explained that there will be many Product Extraction Sheets for every extraction is great information I wasn’t aware of and I think it would be great info for newbies who purchase WEBS to see on a diagram how those things work together.
Also, some type explanation/definition for each heading in the spreadsheets. For Example: Google Sheet URL on Product Extraction Sheet. What is that referencing? It would be nice to see that in the spreadsheet when you hover over the Heading.

586,Converting from TWF Scouting & Sourcing Spreadsheet to WEBS,Flowster-specific,[],Mitch,"Hi Kevin,
I’m not sure if we have a diagram of just sourcing.  Basically though, you have two options: Leaf Sourcing or Brand Sourcing (Option 1).  Within Leaf Sourcing, we have SOPs to do extractions using PC2 and Tactical Arbitrage (Option 1b).  So you decide whether to Leaf Source or Brand Source and start at step 1 of whichever you choose.  You then proceed through the SOPs numbered by step for whichever direction you chose.  If you chose leaf sourcing and want to use Tactical Arbitrage, you go from Leaf Sourcing Step 1 to Leaf Sourcing Step 2 with Tactical Arbitrage, and then Sourcing Step 3, 4, and lastly 5.

Sourcing____Folder____Flowster1544×602 127 KB

No matter which direction you choose, you start with the Overview and HubSpot Configuration SOPs.  You then will end with Handling Bounced Emails and Recording Your Statistics.

What is the point of optimizing your listing and choosing your keywords?
Keywords on Amazon are almost entirely responsibile for your listing traffic. When you have a keyword in your title, description, or bullets you can “rank” for that keyword. This means that when a customer searches for a product using this keyword your Amazon page is more likely to show up in the results.
This is why it is so important to do the proper keyword research and inject these keywords into your listing.
What tools do you need to add the keywords into your listing?
In this process, we are going to show you how to use Cerebro, Magnet2, Frankenstein, and Scribbles to fully optimize your listing.
Overview of the process that this SOP will teach

Collect your ASIN and a root keyword
Use H10’s Cerebro for keyword mining
Use Cerebro to find key phrases
Use H10’s Magnet 2
Collect your possible search terms
Use H10’s Frankenstein to remove duplicate search terms
Use Scribbles to draft your content

There is no reason to have different sellers to cover different regions because Amazon will distribute the product to their warehouses across the country.
In addition, the number of sellers selling a brand is not important for marketing. It is in fact easier with one seller because you can trust all of your data more and do not have to coordinate with other sellers on campaigns.
What I am much more concerned about is the opportunity. Are they asking you to invest $60,000 in a product that has never been on Amazon? It sounds like the brand is new to market and they have immediate sales expectations. There should be zero expectations. There can be no guarantee of success with a brand new product.
It also sounds like they have money problems which seems like a red flag to me.",3,187,2

You’re right about the Amazon distribution system if it was FBA. He is talking about FBM in this case. In 2018 there was approximately 37% of amazon users that do not have FBA and were buying FBM.

I have already signed an exclusive contract and they have one product. I was inquiring about a future product that is adding value to the single product of theirs I’m selling now.

All completed and in progress workflows are managed (showing who is assigned to which Product Extraction, the status of the Product Extraction, etc) in the Competitor Tracking document (shown in Sourcing Step 1).
Some Product Extractions will take longer than others (due to size and number of product), so it is very common that one VA will finish 10 Product Extractions faster than others. To avoid running out we assign 5-10 Product Extractions each week so that there are always Product Extractions that need to be completed. If the VA runs out of Product Extractions, then we just assign more.
At the EOD (end of day) reports our VAs send any issues will be brought up by the VA. This includes if they are running out of Product Extractions.

803,Strategies to Reduce Shipping Costs,Fulfillment,['Shipping'],classic,"Shipping is a big expense in our business. We have all sorts of things we’ve done to reduce costs:


we always ask if better shipping prices are available


we shop around whenever possible… with our freight broker, with UPS vs FedEx, etc… prices change all the time and if we don’t shop around we’ll miss those changes


if we’re sending parcel shipments, we’ll sometimes repackage in larger boxes - as close to 50 lb as we can get so we don’t run into oversize fees


If we’re selling FBM items on Amazon around the $10 price point, we’ll price them at $9.99 so we don’t have to provide tracking… this keeps shipping costs down substantially and nets us more than listing the product for $10.99

Sadly, most of these resolutions (lose weight, make more money, find love, etc…) will never become a reality.
Why?
Because they are not supported by an action plan that makes achieving these goals the likely outcome.
What do I mean?
In order to achieve more, you need to have a clearly defined action plan, supported by a set of daily & weekly habits. Without this in place, your goals are nothing more than things you hope to achieve, and I can assure that hope is not a strategy for success.
Hoping that the train coming towards you on the tracks doesn’t kill you is not nearly as effective as simply moving out of the way!
In my prior emails, I’ve been talking a great deal about a book called The Slight Edge.
Over the holidays, I mentioned this book to several of my friends and did my best to encourage them to read it.
If you have started to read the book, I’d love for you to share your biggest take away so far. Do it now, ok? Even if it is only a sentence or two.
In my case, my biggest take away has been that I now think about how to “Slight Edge” pretty much everything in my life…and as a result, forming important daily habits has become much easier for me.
I now have a habit app on my phone called Productive and each day, I’m reminded of the following habits:

Read 10 pages of a book
Minimum of 20 minutes of cardio
20 minutes of meditation
Write in my gratitude journal
Take a few moments and consciously think about something specific that I appreciate about my wife and daughter

By starting my day at 5:30, I have plenty of time for all of the above and it is a fantastic way to start my day!
As for my action plan, I have my “big rocks” for the first 90 days of 2020 already committed to writing, supported by a detailed action plan to achieve them. My wife and I then review this plan vs our progress each month so that we can see if we are on track or not.
If you have goals you are committed to achieving in your business in 2020, I encourage you to take the same approach.",0,0,0
885,Takeaway #1 from mastermind,Management,[],Trent-Admin,"While I was at the mastermind weekend I wrote about yesterday, I took about 10 pages of notes that are going to massively boost my income in 2020.
Over the next week or so, I’m going to share some of my biggest takeaways.
Here’s the first…
If you are selling stuff online, you should seriously consider building (and amplifying) a personal brand.
Why?
Authority, credibility, and revenue on demand. (Bright Ideas is the most profitable thing I do)
While I have been building my brand for years, I have not been amplifying it nearly as well as I should have been. In 2020, that is going to change and my income is going to go up. A lot.
How do you amplify?
Ad spend.
More ad spend = more eyeballs = more subscribers = more revenue on demand.
Tomorrow, I’ll dig more into the ways to do this.
For today, my ask is this: please take 2 minutes right now to complete my community feedback survey 2.
Why? Because I’m going to come out with some free training material for you and if you don’t tell me what you want/need, I won’t know what to create.
Sound fair?
Go fill out the survey 2 now, ok?",2,301,2
886,Takeaway #1 from mastermind,Management,[],Trent-Admin,"Hi Trent, thank you for this useful insight.
How is this specifically helping you to grow your Amazon business?
I understand the importance of building a personal brand, but are you suggesting that to be something complementary to the amazon business and potentially making an other income stream through for example podcasts, courses, blogs, etc?
Is this what you mean or am I missing something?
Thanks",2,301,2
887,Takeaway #1 from mastermind,Management,[],Trent-Admin,"On more than one occasion, brands that we spoke with mentioned that they had research me and, thanks to all the content I produce, they were very complimentary of my skills/experience and each time this happened, we won the account.",2,301,2
888,Pain is necessary,Management,[],Trent-Admin,"Today I started my morning like I always do; by watching motivational speeches on Youtube while I’m in the bathroom shaving, brushing my teeth, etc…
I like to start my day this way because it fires me up and ensures that when I sit down at my desk, I’m ready to make shit happen!
If you don’t yet have a morning routine that includes meditation, consuming inspirational content, and whatever else you need to get your head in the game, I’d like to challenge you to start TODAY.
To help you with that, I’m going to share with you the video that I watched this morning: https://youtu.be/3wi65UW_nJk 3
This video was created by an African American man who grew up in the projects. His name is William King Hollis and if you think you have any disadvantages that are preventing you from being more successful in business and in life, I suspect hearing his story might help you to put that in perspective.
If you want to be successful in business; pain is necessary. If it wasn’t, everyone would own a successful company, wouldn’t they?
The difference between those that do, and those that only talk, is their ability to suffer through the pain.
Want proof? Think about anyone that has ever won a gold medal. Think their training was pain free?
Think about any actor that has hit it big. Think their early years were pain free?
I doubt it.
Pain is necessary. If you want to become financially successful, you have to be 100% committed to that goal; regardless of how much pain you are going to have to endure.
Now go make it happen!
Trent

889,Takeaway #2 from the Mastermind Weekend,Management,[],Trent-Admin,"Today I’m going to share my next big takeaway from the mastermind I attended last weekend.
As I wrote yesterday, the biggest area that I have dropped the ball in building my personal brand has been to rely solely on organic traffic and not use any advertising.
In 2020, I’m going to start advertising, and I’m going to do it in two ways.
Way #1: Facebook retargeting campaigns. Thankfully, I’ve had a Facebook pixel on my site for ages, so my Facebook audience will be pretty big and as retargeting is the cheapest way to advertise online, showing ads to people who have already been to my site will be pretty inexpensive.
Way #2: Running Youtube ads to cold traffic (people who have never been to my site and have no idea who I am). These campaigns will be more costly and I actually did experiment with them a tiny bit in mid 2019.
Being as I want to learn a lot more about running ad campaigns, expect me to publish more interviews with ad experts in the weeks/months ahead.
In fact, I just recorded one with a woman who used to work at both Facebook and Instagram and I’m working on putting a deal together with her to run my campaigns for me.
When it comes to running ads, you have to lay the right foundation, and a huge part of that foundation is knowing exactly what your audience wants, as well as the language they use to describe it.
That is why I’m asking you to take 2 minutes to fill out my community feedback survey.
Why take the time to help me? Because I’m going to help you by coming out with more free training material for you and if you don’t tell me what you want/need, I won’t know what to create.

892,How to significantly increase your supplier lead generation,Management,[],Trent-Admin,"On yesterday’s eCommerce Fast Track mastermind call, one of our members (Ben) and I talked about some of the things I learned while at the mastermind, and what I’m about to share with you is particularly applicable to your prospecting for new suppliers.
Why do so many sellers struggle to generate product/supplier leads?
They struggle because lead generation is a level 3 problem and they start doing it before completing the work needed for level 1 and level 2.
What are the first two levels, you ask?
Level 1 is authority and level 2 is positioning.
Think about this for a minute. If I’m trying to get you to book a call with me to consider partnering up to sell your products on Amazon and I don’t have any authority/credibility, how likely are you going to be to book a call with me?
Not very likely.
Now considering my positioning (messaging).
If one Amazon seller’s website messaging is “we sell on Amazon” and their competitor’s messaging is “we help brands solve Amazon-related problems”; which company would be more likely to appeal to a brand?
Obviously, it would be the company that helps brands solve their problems (because there are already far too many sellers that don’t do anything more than sell the product)
So…does it make sense to you that generating leads would be a lot easier if you have plenty of authority and the right positioning?
Of course it would be easier!

893,What is the biggest obstacle to your success?,Management,[],Mitch,"Yesterday, I was down in San Diego for the final day of a 2-day mastermind event filled with other online business owners doing 6-7 figures and the new ideas and growth strategies that I have been exposed to over the last weekend were nothing short of incredible.
I also realized that, much to my disgust, I’ve had a few limiting beliefs preventing me from ramping up my business even faster.
For example; every entrepreneur on planet earth struggles to raise capital; especially in the beginning.
Did you know that there is a way to access capital with a 0% interest?
Did you know that you can use this capital to buy inventory, hire employees, and even buy a business or real estate?
If someone had walked up to me on the street and told me this was possible, I would have laughed at them.
Well guess what? I was wrong, and you can access this capital simply by googling “zero interest credit cards”.
The worst part about limiting beliefs is that we usually don’t even know if we have them.
To find yours, all you need to do is hang out with people more successful than you, be curious, and ask questions.

The importance of how you position your company when talking to brands


Regarding his website, I gave Nick the following advice: Study Netrush.com 2 and Pattern.com 6 to see the types of content they publish and then do something similar. He needs to write the content himself, and if he doesn’t know how to build a Wordpress site, he can easily find helpers on Fiverr.com or upwork.com. It will be very inexpensive. The other thing I suggested was that when talking to brands, he needs to position his company as an omni-channel retailer, and the website must support that talking point.

916,Hear from a $65M Seller,Management,['Leadership'],Trent-Admin,"On today’s eCommerce Fast Track 13 conference call, we talked about some really cool stuff!
The first item discussed was a Reddit AMA 19 from a $65 million dollar seller by the name of BuyBoxer 3. I haven’t read the entire thread yet, but you can bet I’m going to! One take away was that this company is spending $1,500/mo for Keep a data.
You can bet I’d like to better understand how they are using this data and I’m planning to dig into it. If you have thoughts on how they are using it, reply in the comments, ok?
After that, we talked at length about the anatomy of a discovery call with a prospective brand. How to start the call, what to say, questions to ask, etc…
Making sure you are scheduling as many of these calls as you can (from the replies you receive) is absolutely critical to your success. If you are new, doing these calls will give you practice…and then once you have been doing them for a while, you will start winning more accounts.
As proof of that, earlier this week, I was speaking with the sales rep who works for a friend’s Amazon business, and she told me that if she can schedule a call with a brand that says, “we don’t want any more Amazon sellers”, that she can win the account 80-90% of the time. The big lesson here is this: GET ON THE PHONE at every chance you can.
Next, we talked about two new podcast interviews that are going to be published in the next few weeks (http://brightideas.co/273 4 and http://brightideas.co/274 3). In these interviews, I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager, why it is important, and how to use it, plus something called attributed revenue.
Why should you care about this stuff? Simple. The more you know about digital marketing, the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands…and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you, if for no other reason than to get access to your brain.

I would put the TWF course into the context the “why and what” you need to do to get a wholesale business going and the material from Trent on Flowser as the “how” to put the learnings into practice.

It is up to you if you want to charge them, but personally I think it would be better to either have a flat fee or to offer it as a partner gift. Offering services like this shows that you care about the brand and your long-term relationship with them.
WEBS has an Optimization template in the Product Listing Folder.
One thing I would really upsell is optimizing back end keyword optimizations (we use Helium 10 for this —we have a code that we use for 10% off, and we included it in the Free SOP in the Flowster marketplace). It takes very little time to do, especially with H10 or VL, but can make a huge difference. We make sure to mention that front end and back end optimizations are different.",1,190,4

Anyone have any good strategies other than not selling this product any more?",3,222,4

940,Dealing With Idiots,Misc Topics,[],scottschmitz,"@scottschmitz I don’t think we have ever reached out to sellers to discuss pricing before but sometimes I would certainly like to.  Distributor sourced products are often very price competitive but, if the brand has MAP in place, you may try reaching out directly to them to start a conversation.  It could be a good in to better pricing or marketplace exclusivity.
If there is no MAP policy or the brand doesn’t care, you can keep an eye on the seller’s stock and wait for stock outages or quit buying the product.  Distributor products are tough like that as a good money maker can be flipped off by a low I.Q. seller at any time.  Sorry I don’t have any great strategy for this.
Best,

I would like to know if I walked into your storefront that you have in your warehouse. Can I buy product there?  I only ask because I have an opportunity to add a storefront to my warehouse and I really don’t want the hassle of selling to walk inns but I realize that brands want this.   How do you negotiate this and if you do sell.  How much stock do you keep for you retail store.",0,199,3
