      "However I will not be listing these products on Amazon for sale So how to “add a product” without having it available for sale on amazon but still exist so that I can set up a shipment to the fulfillment center with that product ['\\nI want to set up my products on Amazon so that I can start setting up my shipment to the amazon warehouse for fulfillment on my website orders My understanding is that in order to do this I need to “add a product”\\nHowever I will not be listing these products on Amazon for sale So how to “add a product” without having it available for sale on amazon but still exist so that I can set up a shipment to the fulfillment center with that product\\n', ' \\nI don’t think amazon is set up to work that way I’m still trying to figure out why you would want to do this even if you could What advantages do you think you would gain in doing so\\n', ' \\nBefore I give my answer to your question I would like to add that I think you would benefit from listing your product on Amazon It’s unlikely to have an effect on your existing website sales but it could definitely add a whole new revenue source to your business\\nAmazon offers ‘Multichannel fulfilment’ which allows you to essentially copy orders from your website or any other marketplace and have them fulfilled from an Amazon warehouse\\nHowever if you just need the fulfilment facilities then there are other companies which do this that are much less expensive than Amazon Amazon charges higher fees for FBA if the product was not sold on their site But if you’re selling on Amazon and your website then FBA is the way to go and is what I do since I live in the UK but most of my orders are in the USA so it’s not economically to ship every order internationally\\nHope this helps a bit\\n', ' \\nyou can also look into other fulfillment places then you don’t have to deal with any product issues you may or may not have with amazon\\nWe use one for another marketplace and they work really well\\n', ' \\nYou can create the product  listing as FBA send it in to the Fulfillment Center then while it’s in transit switch to FBM You’ll always need to switch to FBA to send in more stuff but it will mean that you have an active listing stock on hand and no display on the Amazon site\\nTo the other posters the OP may have found that Amazon’s commission is too large for him to sell it on their marketplace\\n', ' \\nIf you do not want to sell FBA there are so many other perhaps better and less expensive fulfillment houses Use them\\n', ' \\n\\n\\n', '\\n ThisIsPapaya', '\\n\\nSo how to “add a product” without having it available for sale on amazon\\n\\n\\nYou can’t\\n', ' \\nThanks for the insights everyone My comments to all the questionscomments are below PS the products I’ll be selling is under my own brand\\n\\n\\nI would consider NOT selling on Amazon and only selling on my website in the scenario where my customer acquisition costs is less than the 15 amazon charges me If I can acquire customers through Instagram targeted Adsinfluencers for a cost of lets say 10 of my selling price then I prefer use my inventory for sales outside of Amazon which are more profitable\\n\\n\\nThat being said in case I can’t reach high volumes through my other avenues of advertising or my customer acquisition cost is higher than 15 I’ll then want to turn on the amazon listing as well This is why I’d like to use FBA and not another fulfillment center  so I can easily toggle on Amazon sales if necessary\\n\\n\\nYeStorePosters thanks for the MultiFulfillment Comment Sounds like this is the avenue to utilizing FBA without listing a product on Amazon I will do some research on this any further insight from you on this matter can be helpful At the same time I will start looking into other fulfillment providers  putting cost aside for a moment how much better or worse are they than FBA\\n', '']\n",
