Amazon is concerned about the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), as seen on our Important notification regarding impacts of the Novel Coronavirus posted February 7.
We are seeing an increase in the number of off-topic coronavirus posts made in the forums. Please be mindful and refrain from posting about the coronavirus when it is off-topic, as per the Forum Guidelines 70.

The Moderators","['\n\n\n James_Amazon:\n\noff-topic coronavirus posts\n\n\nCan you please define for us what is on topic?\nIs it okay to start a thread on sanitary packing techniques?\nHow about a thread on the safe handling and buying of items at a garage sale?', '\n\n\n rms:\n\nIs it okay to start a thread on sanitary packing techniques?\n\n\nI think you would be ok with doing that.\nThere is no way that a starting a thread could be “off-topic”.\nSince it is the topic ', 'Hey @James_Amazon\nI think since it is the main topic of everyone’s day to day conversation it is to be expected to a degree.\nWe hope that Amazon will keep sellers informed of any closures or changes that are going to be made because of this virus and it will  help stop the gossip and off topic conversations. Personally, I have seen too many “Warehouses are closing” and doom and gloom alarmist posts and appreciate your post but also send a tremendous amount of inventory to you and am hoping that Amazon keeps us all informed of any changes as they arise and not leave us in the dark.', '\n\n\n Northern_Cards:\n\nThere is no way that a starting a thread could be “off-topic”.\nSince it is the topic\n\n\nSo it would seem to a reasonable person.  But there are lots of off-topic posts in many threads, and they seldom get remarked upon by mods.\nIt seems odd that a mod would focus on off topic CV-19 posts and not other off-topic posts.  I was wondering if this was a roundabout way of saying “No CV-19 posts.”\nWhat I was trying to determine is if CV19 posts are permitted at all.', '\n\n\n rms:\n\nBut there are lots of off-topic posts in many threads, and they seldom get remarked upon by mods\n\n\nThat’s very true.\n\n\n\n rms:\n\nIt seems odd that a mod would focus on off topic CV-19 posts and not other off-topic posts.\n\n\nOf course I can’t speak for the mods. However, I can speak for myself as someone who spends way too much time in forum.\nI understand that CV-19 is an important subject that impacts sellers on a daily basis. However it seems that occasionally when folks get off-topic with CV-19, things tend to occasionally get ugly, very quickly. Including wildly inaccurate scientific information, as well as comments which could be perceived as racist.\nWhile the propagation of misinformation isn’t explicitly prohibited, it’s certainly not helpful and it can be dangerous. However, insulting groups of people is prohibited.\n\nProfanity, obscenities, or spiteful remarks.\nInsults of other groups or individuals.\n\nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/faq 26\nSo like I said, I have no idea what Amazon’s thinking is. But, it’s my best guess they might want to shut things down more quickly on these posts, before things go too far off the rails.', '\n\n\n James_Amazon:\n\nPlease be mindful and refrain from posting about the coronavirus when it is off-topic\n\n\nOr when you’re posting on topic threads about it those seem to be an issue too.', '\n\n\n Northern_Cards:\n\nThere is no way that a starting a thread could be “off-topic”.\nSince it is the topic\n\n\nThats kind of what I thought when mine got locked.

3,How do I sell books overseas for Amazon shipping rates,Selling on Amazon,['General Selling Questions'],Picks_by_Nisha,"['Texas_Exile_Books', 'left_coast_books', 'Edge_Art']",I do not know of any carriers that will ship even an 11 ounce book to any country overseas (even Mexico) for the Amazon required rate of $16.95. Is there some special category or company that must be used? Most of the time it is over 1 pound so first class is not available and it is does not allow tracking either.,"['The rate for Mexico is close to that range; note that if you buy shipping through Amazon, you get prices that are better than retail in most cases.\nIf you have the professional plan, you can set your own shipping rates, and even have different rates for different countries (as well as block some countries that are notoriously bad).\nI’m still figuring out details of international shipping, but my cheapest books are not available outside the US; that way, if the shipping charge doesn’t quite cover the cost of postage, I’m still making money (not to mention that that additional hassle isn’t really worth it for a $10 book).\nBut right now, I would recommend turning off international shipping; there are simply too many countries that are not accepting shipments from the US, and even for those that are, both their and the US mail systems are having problems at the moment.', 'I discontinued international orders on Amazon this week. While I have a mix of trade paperbacks and the usual octavo hardcovers, the only international orders I have been getting recently were for massive folio art books and book sets. Amazon is inflexible.

4,"Item Delivered, Signed for.. Customer Claims not received and wants refund… HELP!",Selling on Amazon,['General Selling Questions'],Living_In_a_Van,"['goodseller_2483', 'Harbor_Motorsports']","Customer Purchased a car wheel on 05/16/2020. Confirmed order with customer and shipped out item with DSR (Direct Signature Required) FedEx. I purchased shipping through my own FedEx account since it gives me better prices.
Due to COVID-19, FedEx/UPS implemented the no touch signature, meaning they won’t let the customer touch the pad to sign, but they’ll ask for the name of the person getting the package, type their name and sign COVID. That’s been implemented since 03/2020.
Item delivered 05/26/2020 at 09:35 am PST. Customer states he work from home and contacted me at 6pm that same day saying package was not delivered and the online signature doesn’t match his. Sent me a copy of license (I did not request it) and stated no package arrived, even though it’s signed for and shows delivered, his first initial and last name. I suggested to file a claim with FedEx for the item cost since package was fully insured and signature is always required on any package(s) I ship.
FedEx denied the claim stating they confirmed delivery of the item and the driver stated he gave the customer the item. Since then, he requested a refund for the item. I stated I cannot refund for an item that’s been signed for and delivered. Price of the item is $360.

After delivery, he signed the pad with COVID, following the guidelines put in place to keep the required distance.\nFedEx stated they’re waiving the signature requirement from the customer directly due to the pandemic. Do I just start buying shipping via Amazon shipping again to not have to deal with this issue?', 'Explain to the customer that they need to request a refund directly from Amazon.\nInform them that the reason needs to be item not received or package not delivered.

If the Post Office marks the package as “delivered” and they claim they did not receive it, you would send them a form (if U-Pic works like Auctiva) which they must fill out and swear under penalty of perjury to the truthfulness of their statement on non receipt.  Once they file it and you file your documentation you are reimbursed (including postage if you declare the cost in total value you purchase).', 'Not bad honestly. This may be a good “glitch”. I have been putting 0 to be able to print my labels, but am now contemplating whether to start really using this insurance. Thank you for the info.']",0,0
