Personally, I have seen too many \u201cWarehouses are closing\u201d and doom and gloom alarmist posts and appreciate your post but also send a tremendous amount of inventory to you and am hoping that Amazon keeps us all informed of any changes as they arise and not leave us in the dark.", "\n\n\n Northern_Cards:\n\nThere is no way that a starting a thread could be \u201coff-topic\u201d.\nSince it is the topic\n\n\nSo it would seem to a reasonable person.  But there are lots of off-topic posts in many threads, and they seldom get remarked upon by mods.\nIt seems odd that a mod would focus on off topic CV-19 posts and not other off-topic posts.  I was wondering if this was a roundabout way of saying \u201cNo CV-19 posts.\u201d\nWhat I was trying to determine is if CV19 posts are permitted at all.", "\n\n\n rms:\n\nBut there are lots of off-topic posts in many threads, and they seldom get remarked upon by mods\n\n\nThat\u2019s very true.\n\n\n\n rms:\n\nIt seems odd that a mod would focus on off topic CV-19 posts and not other off-topic posts.\n\n\nOf course I can\u2019t speak for the mods. However, I can speak for myself as someone who spends way too much time in forum.\nI understand that CV-19 is an important subject that impacts sellers on a daily basis. However it seems that occasionally when folks get off-topic with CV-19, things tend to occasionally get ugly, very quickly. Including wildly inaccurate scientific information, as well as comments which could be perceived as racist.\nWhile the propagation of misinformation isn\u2019t explicitly prohibited, it\u2019s certainly not helpful and it can be dangerous. However, insulting groups of people is prohibited.\n\nProfanity, obscenities, or spiteful remarks.\nInsults of other groups or individuals.\n\nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/faq 26\nSo like I said, I have no idea what Amazon\u2019s thinking is. But, it\u2019s my best guess they might want to shut things down more quickly on these posts, before things go too far off the rails.", "\n\n\n James_Amazon:\n\nPlease be mindful and refrain from posting about the coronavirus when it is off-topic\n\n\nOr when you\u2019re posting on topic threads about it those seem to be an issue too.", "\n\n\n Northern_Cards:\n\nThere is no way that a starting a thread could be \u201coff-topic\u201d.\nSince it is the topic\n\n\nThats kind of what I thought when mine got locked.
