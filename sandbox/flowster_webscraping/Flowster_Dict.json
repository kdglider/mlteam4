All I am sharing below is based solely on my own personal experience, and professional advice provided to me. I strongly recommending you always seek independent legal and/or financial advice.\nI hope the following helps you better understand the issue so that you can gain a bit more clarity and decide how to move forward.\nI too am non US resident and I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about in this scenario.\nThis is one of the reasons I actually shut down my US single member LLC and established a company in my own country.\nAmazon\u2019s tax interview is setup correctly, and does ask the correct questions from a tax perspective.\nThe issue is however, their system drags across the single member details and uses that same information as the legal entity, thus why your personal name shows up as the legal entity inside of Seller Central.\nI escalated this issue on numerous occasions with Amazon and explained the issue even at their legal level, however, despite also having sought clarification through a US based tax attorney, Amazon still said it is setup correctly in their system.\nThere is no way around it as a single member LLC entity when you\u2019re an international non resident single member.\nThe biggest issue I could foresee with this is that your vendor issued invoices will always be in the name of the legal entity, your LLC, and so this will never match with Amazon\u2019s backend system.\nIf Amazon ever asks for invoices for verification, you\u2019ll very likely hit major issues, an unlikely be able to prove anything.\nOperating under wholesale business model using that legal structure is risky, especially with the level of frivolous IP and authenticity claims that occur on the platform now.\nYou\u2019ll also never be able to get ungated if requested to provide invoices because again, the entity details wont\u2019 match. I know this for sure because I experienced and lost money from it.\nAlso, be aware of the additional reporting requirements that the IRS now has in place for non resident LLCs.\nVery few people are aware of these new requirements until it is too late.\nThere are all very important considerations you should understand when deciding to continue operating as a US entity, and another reason why I would suggest you seek professional advice from someone who specialises in US tax law for NON US residents.\nI hope this helps.\nAll the best.": "AnthonyD", "Hey there,\nThanks very much for your very detailed reply, really appreciate it.\nYes those issues you mentioned i already came across (invoices with my LLC name) but i got around it by asking them to put my own name and address on it, which they were happy to do but that just sounds amateur to most suppliers i\u2019m sure.\nI\u2019ll be getting in touch with a professional as well as looking into a limited company in my own country.\nI assume you\u2019re operating under your company name in your home country, my i ask if your US suppliers have an issue with this?\nThanks very much again": "watson", "Hi,\nI\u2019m glad it helped.\nUnfortunately it\u2019s another one of the many challenges us internationals experience when starting out on the marketplace in the USA.\nYes I established a new company in my home country and then applied for an EIN, which you will need to sell on the marketplace, and yes, it is very easy to get via a phone call to the IRS.\nThen it\u2019s up to you whether you get a reseller certificate.\nYou don\u2019t need one, however you will find a LOT of brand owners who won\u2019t open an account unless you provide them with one, even when you clearly explain that you\u2019re an entity domiciled outside of the USA so legally don\u2019t need one as I was advised by a tax attorney.\nIt\u2019s more to remove that as an objection, but it does come with compliance requirements.\nOnce again, decide which way is right for you once you speak with a professional.\nHope this helps.": "AnthonyD", "Hi,\nI\u2019ll be investigating your way of doing things this weekend.\nThis information is a massive help, and once again, it\u2019s hugely appreciated!\nWish you all the best with your business\nP.S Anyone following this i\u2019ll update it if i have anything new to report about this issue": "watson", "Hi AnthonyD.\nVery useful advice, thanks for sharing.\nAre you able to share the details of the accountant you use please?
