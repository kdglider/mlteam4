      "I watched a Viral Launch webinar (tried to find the replay link but couldn’t) that talked about the pros of the request a review button.  Basically, the customer doesn’t have to click any links to leave a product review.  They can leave a review within the follow up.  Also, customers no longer have to leave a written review to give a star rating.  The ease with which customers can leave a review in this strategy has made review rates increase significantly.  Viral Launch used an AirPods listing as an example.  The listing had 3,000 reviews when the request a review feature was implemented in September 2019.  They were at 38,000 reviews and a 4.6 star rating by February.\n",

      "Disclaimer first: I’m not a US tax accountant or US financial advisor. All I am sharing below is based solely on my own personal experience, and professional advice provided to me. I strongly recommending you always seek independent legal and/or financial advice.\n",
      "I hope the following helps you better understand the issue so that you can gain a bit more clarity and decide how to move forward.\n",
      "I too am non US resident and I know exactly what you’re talking about in this scenario.\n",
      "This is one of the reasons I actually shut down my US single member LLC and established a company in my own country.\n",
      "Amazon’s tax interview is setup correctly, and does ask the correct questions from a tax perspective.\n",
      "The issue is however, their system drags across the single member details and uses that same information as the legal entity, thus why your personal name shows up as the legal entity inside of Seller Central.\n",
      "I escalated this issue on numerous occasions with Amazon and explained the issue even at their legal level, however, despite also having sought clarification through a US based tax attorney, Amazon still said it is setup correctly in their system.\n",
      "There is no way around it as a single member LLC entity when you’re an international non resident single member.\n",
      "The biggest issue I could foresee with this is that your vendor issued invoices will always be in the name of the legal entity, your LLC, and so this will never match with Amazon’s backend system.\n",
      "If Amazon ever asks for invoices for verification, you’ll very likely hit major issues, an unlikely be able to prove anything.\n",
      "Operating under wholesale business model using that legal structure is risky, especially with the level of frivolous IP and authenticity claims that occur on the platform now.\n",
      "You’ll also never be able to get ungated if requested to provide invoices because again, the entity details wont’ match. I know this for sure because I experienced and lost money from it.\n",
      "Also, be aware of the additional reporting requirements that the IRS now has in place for non resident LLCs.\n",
      "Very few people are aware of these new requirements until it is too late.\n",
      "There are all very important considerations you should understand when deciding to continue operating as a US entity, and another reason why I would suggest you seek professional advice from someone who specialises in US tax law for NON US residents.\n",

      "When pitching my company business model to other entrepreneurs, specifically referring to the wholesale model that focus on closing special agreements with brands to have exclusive distribution on Amazon, I always get asked whether what I provide is a service or not.\n",
      "I initially thought it was not but then I realized that working on the same offer but providing it  as a service might be convenient under certain aspects.\n",
      "In the “traditional” wholesale model, my company would first close an agreement for the exclusivity to be the only seller of those products on Amazon, then I would periodically buy the products from the brand and do as much as I can to improve sales because it will benefit me (improve pics, listing and invest in ppc)\n",
      "On the other hand, if I would give the same kind of offer to the brand, but offering it as a service, I would manage their Amazon account (still being the only seller as I would represent the brand itself) but this time I won’t need to purchase any stock in advance (as the brand would provide them), and I will not need to invest in any optimization as it’s their account so I can offer that to them as a service. In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock.\n",
      "I see in the service case (so essentially providing Amazon account management) similar upsides to the “traditional” model (eg. exclusivity) but less downsize (eg. no need to purchase stock in advance)\n",
      "What are your thoughts about this? Am I missing anything?\n",
      "My other biggest concern in the “traditional” model is: how do you make sure that the brand won’t end the exclusivity agreement after you have built BSR for their products and invested in PPC and listing optimization?\n",

      "We’ve found that the accounts where we are sending them checks (buying inventory) are much less headache than when they’re sending us checks (service model).\n",
      "We do ask brands to sign a contract for 6 mo (which auto renews), but the best way to make sure they won’t end the exclusivity agreement is to do great work for them. We also try not to expend any more capital (subcontractor, labor, etc) towards growing the account than the profit we make from the account. We’re pretty transparent with the brand about this.\n",

      "Hi Kevin,\n",
      "You would transfer that data into a Product Extraction Sheet.  I’m not sure what all data is in the TWF Scouting & Sourcing Spreadsheet so it may be a little funky but I’m sure there is some data crossover between what the two spreadsheets find important.\n",
      "As far as overall strategy, think of the Master Import Spreadsheet as your directory for imports.  You will only have one copy of this.  You will have many copies of the Product Extraction Sheet.  One for each extraction you do and each one will be recorded in the Master Import Spreadsheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comment 4: \n",
      "Thank you Mitch. That helps tremendously. I saw a diagram that illustrates the workflow for the whole (WEBS) system. Does there happen to be a diagram (or something similar) that shows the sourcing workflow? Just how you explained that there will be many Product Extraction Sheets for every extraction is great information I wasn’t aware of and I think it would be great info for newbies who purchase WEBS to see on a diagram how those things work together.\n",
      "Also, some type explanation/definition for each heading in the spreadsheets. For Example: Google Sheet URL on Product Extraction Sheet. What is that referencing? It would be nice to see that in the spreadsheet when you hover over the Heading.\n",

      "Hi Kevin,\n",
      "I’m not sure if we have a diagram of just sourcing.  Basically though, you have two options: Leaf Sourcing or Brand Sourcing (Option 1).  Within Leaf Sourcing, we have SOPs to do extractions using PC2 and Tactical Arbitrage (Option 1b).  So you decide whether to Leaf Source or Brand Source and start at step 1 of whichever you choose.  You then proceed through the SOPs numbered by step for whichever direction you chose.  If you chose leaf sourcing and want to use Tactical Arbitrage, you go from Leaf Sourcing Step 1 to Leaf Sourcing Step 2 with Tactical Arbitrage, and then Sourcing Step 3, 4, and lastly 5.\n",

      "Each heading in the spreadsheet should be explained in the SOPs if they aren’t self explanatory (such as the Google Sheet URL).\n",

If your initial analysis and order are just days apart, I’d still recommend analyzing twice.  Shortcuts and under-analysis are good ways to lose money.\n",

      "My background is distribution, so hopefully I can give some info.  The questions truly depends on the size of the distributor.  You have distributors that are small and local all the way up to distributors that do 25-100 Billion annually.  Even with that said all distributors are focused on selling product.  Your typical distributor has slim margins, so they want more volume.  The larger distributors the only true value you can add is sales volume.  Unfortunately until your buying big #s that is not a real value prop.   For the smaller distributor you may be able to add value by helping them get sales volume on new items they bring in or slower items they need sales on.  The very very small distributors may need help in other areas, but the med to big ones just want sales in my experience.\n",

The Keepa box is something you’ll naturally just starting peeking at when you open a product page as it is a good source of quick information.  For deep analysis, the data tab of the Keepa box has very useful information such as the 90D Buybox average and 90D average sellers.  If you don’t have a paid account, you can access the data tab about 10 times per month.\n",
      "How many is used to see inventory levels.  If Keepa says the 90D average sellers number is 2 and there are currently 3 sellers but How Many shows they only have 3 items in stock, you can guess with decent certainty that the seller will not remain on the listing.  Still ask the brand about them though.  Both tools I use daily and would recommend trying the free version and moving to paid if you see fit.\n",

      "As proof of that, earlier this week, I was speaking with the sales rep who works for a friend’s Amazon business, and she told me that if she can schedule a call with a brand that says, “we don’t want any more Amazon sellers”, that she can win the account 80-90% of the time.
