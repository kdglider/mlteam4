Our best VA can run almost every aspect of our business other than closing a deal.  He could probably do that also if his English was a little better.

Any employee could leave at any time.   We treat our VA’s like we would any other US based employee.  Treat them well and dont give them a reason to leave.

In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock.\nI see in the service case (so essentially providing Amazon account management) similar upsides to the “traditional” model (eg. exclusivity) but less downsize (eg. no need to purchase stock in advance)\nWhat are your thoughts about this? Am I missing anything?\nMy other biggest concern in the “traditional” model is: how do you make sure that the brand won’t end the exclusivity agreement after you have built BSR for their products and invested in PPC and listing optimization?\nOr what can you do to minimize that risk?\nThanks in advance', 'Yes you can absolutely go about it as an account management service.\nThe biggest upside, as you noted, is you don’t have to use a lot of up front capital.\nThe biggest downside is that the brand now sees you as very accountable to provide those services.\nWe’ve found that the accounts where we are sending them checks (buying inventory) are much less headache than when they’re sending us checks (service model).\nWe do ask brands to sign a contract for 6 mo (which auto renews), but the best way to make sure they won’t end the exclusivity agreement is to do great work for them. We also try not to expend any more capital (subcontractor, labor, etc) towards growing the account than the profit we make from the account.

Your brand may have to make some tough decisions.\nIf the distributor will cooperate, they should work with the brand to ensure that all buyers know that products may not be sold on Amazon.\nEither way, Amazon often buys under another name. Here are a partial list of Amazon brands, but they may buy under other names as well:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17602470011](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17602470011&fbclid=IwAR1ADuHuVUsLK9PoifBH74DrlVeChD6vgN4puLGs1mQLkyK9poCWmalcUaw\nMitch has the right idea with the special labeling. If a distributor is cooperating, you are still likely to see people buying products from them and illicitly selling on Amazon. Special labeling (or even marking with a black light pen) will help identify where product is being sourced.\nThere are all sorts of grey market ways Amazon gets their hands on products as well.\nAs for the exclusivity contract, send me an email and I’ll send you a sample template. Thanks!', 'Thank you on such a useful information ! I will send you email.\nRegards,\nIvan']"

The questions truly depends on the size of the distributor.  You have distributors that are small and local all the way up to distributors that do 25-100 Billion annually.  Even with that said all distributors are focused on selling product.  Your typical distributor has slim margins, so they want more volume.  The larger distributors the only true value you can add is sales volume.  Unfortunately until your buying big #s that is not a real value prop.   For the smaller distributor you may be able to add value by helping them get sales volume on new items they bring in or slower items they need sales on.  The very very small distributors may need help in other areas, but the med to big ones just want sales in my experience.\nHopefully that helps a bit.', 'Thank you Liz and Ben!', 'Distributors: Care about how deep your pockets are.\nManufacturers: Care about how you will represent their brand and if you will damage the consumers image of the brand. If you can provide value to them.\nAlso…you get a better margin when dealing with manufacturers for the most part.']"

If you have thoughts on how they are using it, reply in the comments, ok?\nAfter that, we talked at length about the anatomy of a discovery call with a prospective brand. How to start the call, what to say, questions to ask, etc…\nMaking sure you are scheduling as many of these calls as you can (from the replies you receive) is absolutely critical to your success. If you are new, doing these calls will give you practice…and then once you have been doing them for a while, you will start winning more accounts.\nAs proof of that, earlier this week, I was speaking with the sales rep who works for a friend’s Amazon business, and she told me that if she can schedule a call with a brand that says, “we don’t want any more Amazon sellers”, that she can win the account 80-90% of the time. The big lesson here is this: GET ON THE PHONE at every chance you can.\nNext, we talked about two new podcast interviews that are going to be published in the next few weeks (http://brightideas.co/273 and http://brightideas.co/274). In these interviews, I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager, why it is important, and how to use it, plus something called attributed revenue.\nWhy should you care about this stuff? Simple. The more you know about digital marketing, the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands…and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you, if for no other reason than to get access to your brain.\nBe smart.

Offering services like this shows that you care about the brand and your long-term relationship with them.\nWEBS has an Optimization template in the Product Listing Folder.\nOne thing I would really upsell is optimizing back end keyword optimizations (we use Helium 10 for this —we have a code that we use for 10% off, and we included it in the Free SOP in the Flowster marketplace).

I only ask because I have an opportunity to add a storefront to my warehouse and I really don’t want the hassle of selling to walk inns but I realize that brands want this.   How do you negotiate this and if you do sell.  How much stock do you keep for you retail store.","['If I am posting this in the wrong place, my apologies up front. @LizD.   I would like to know if I walked into your storefront that you have in your warehouse. Can I buy product there?  I only ask because I have an opportunity to add a storefront to my warehouse and I really don’t want the hassle of selling to walk inns but I realize that brands want this.   How do you negotiate this and if you do sell.  How much stock do you keep for you retail store.', '@scottschmitz we would be able to do transactions if needed, but we have not had any walk-ins. You can add a storefront without it needing to be an optimized space. Prices in the storefront match MAP or the Amazon price that we offer.', 'Thank you. Do you get many reps that come to visit the store? I am trying to figure out how “STORE LIKE”  Would you be able so attach any pics of your storefront?', '@scottschmitz We get quite a few reps coming into our store, it is nothing particularly special about our storefront but it does pass the sniff test. Sorry we can’t attach any pictures, as it would show all of our products.']"
