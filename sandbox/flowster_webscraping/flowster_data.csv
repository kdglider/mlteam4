Hello everyone, I‚Äôm having trouble helping to train my VA to find the contact information for brands. My linkedin profile has fifty+ connections, but when doing some brand contact research with my VA we both have been running into blocked pages of people. Keep in mind this is with a LinkedIn premium business account, although it‚Äôs still the first free month.
I‚Äôm wondering if the first free month actually has all the same capability as when I actually start paying next month, but maybe not?
Also, when showing my VA how to find the company website, using that to find their linkedin page, to then use snov.io to find contact information on their company page. What else can I do to help train my VA? I was thinking of just showing her more examples of how I do the research, but maybe there is something else I can get to reveal information about businesses I will be reaching out to?
I know the TWF guys have talked about being able to buy access to business information for each state? Does anyone remember what that‚Äôs called? Is it available through the chamber of commerce of each state?

Hello,
This question is directly related to @Trent_Dyrsmid  business model (hope Trent or anyone that has a good answer can reply to this).
When pitching my company business model to other entrepreneurs, specifically referring to the wholesale model that focus on closing special agreements with brands to have exclusive distribution on Amazon, I always get asked whether what I provide is a service or not.
I initially thought it was not but then I realized that working on the same offer but providing it  as a service might be convenient under certain aspects.
In the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù wholesale model, my company would first close an agreement for the exclusivity to be the only seller of those products on Amazon, then I would periodically buy the products from the brand and do as much as I can to improve sales because it will benefit me (improve pics, listing and invest in ppc)
On the other hand, if I would give the same kind of offer to the brand, but offering it as a service, I would manage their Amazon account (still being the only seller as I would represent the brand itself) but this time I won‚Äôt need to purchase any stock in advance (as the brand would provide them), and I will not need to invest in any optimization as it‚Äôs their account so I can offer that to them as a service. In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock.
I see in the service case (so essentially providing Amazon account management) similar upsides to the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù model (eg. exclusivity) but less downsize (eg. no need to purchase stock in advance)
What are your thoughts about this? Am I missing anything?
My other biggest concern in the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù model is: how do you make sure that the brand won‚Äôt end the exclusivity agreement after you have built BSR for their products and invested in PPC and listing optimization?
Or what can you do to minimize that risk?
Thanks in advance

Hey -
So I have a lead I want to approach with the idea of creating automated emails using Feedback Genius to increase their product sales. They‚Äôre going to list some items on Amazon, but I don‚Äôt think they realize how long it can take to get enough reviews to get their sales flowing.
I want to set up automated emails, customize them to the product, and create a PDF to drive their review rate up to 6-7% using Feedback Genius. I haven‚Äôt done this with new listings before, so I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to discuss this so it‚Äôs set up for win-win from the start.
I‚Äôd also offer to monitor and respond to negative reviews for them.
Anywho, I‚Äôm thinking of telling them they‚Äôll get a much slower rate of reviews without using automated emails or a PDF, which means if I add those two types of value for them, that will shorten their time to grow sales significantly. And the same with responding to the negative product reviews.
So, do I tell them I expect about a .5% review rate without any emails sent, 2% with a custom email sent, and about 6% if we advertise a bonus PDF? And then hold myself accountable for showing them those metrics with Feedback Genius.
And if they‚Äôre convinced, only after they see that value would I ask them to sign a contract.
It‚Äôs scary. Haven‚Äôt done this before. Just know it works.
Interested in your advice,
Dan

Epic day today. We won a new account worth $10K+/mo in gross profit. Only took me two years from the first time I spoke with them until now.
Got a ‚Äúwe are definitely doing business together. I‚Äôm firing 2 of my 4 sellers and adding you as soon as they sell through‚Äù from another account that should be worth $50K to $80K/mo in revenue.
I also have at least 10 really solid leads and I expect to win 2-3 of them at a minimum. Another 20 leads that will need nurturing.
If I had to guess, within 90 days, our revenue will be up over $100K/mo.
Here‚Äôs a few take aways from my time at the conference over the last few days:

Strong selling brands get pitched far more than you can imagine
Some sellers even offer bribes ($10K cash under the table) to get account approval (didn‚Äôt work)
Everyone‚Äôs pitch sounds the same (we‚Äôll help you remove unauthorized sellers and increase sales)

So how do you break through?

Rapport is the key to creating opportunities and winning accounts. If they don‚Äôt like/trust you, you have no chance in hell.
Content plays a role in building trust. Your smile plays a role in generating rapport.
Be persistent. (email & the phone is great for this)
Go after brands that aren‚Äôt yet on everybody‚Äôs radar screen. Look for brands that are the up and comers.
DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND KNOW WTF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

There is a MOUNTAIN of opportunity in wholesale. There is a never ending supply of new brands. You simply have to hustle your ass off to get/keep them, and to do that, you have to want it REALLY BAD.
If you aren‚Äôt bringing your A-game, don‚Äôt bother even trying. You will get beat (every time) by those that did bring their A-game.

we shop around whenever possible‚Ä¶ with our freight broker, with UPS vs FedEx, etc‚Ä¶ prices change all the time and if we don‚Äôt shop around we‚Äôll miss those changes


if we‚Äôre sending parcel shipments, we‚Äôll sometimes repackage in larger boxes - as close to 50 lb as we can get so we don‚Äôt run into oversize fees


If we‚Äôre selling FBM items on Amazon around the $10 price point, we‚Äôll price them at $9.99 so we don‚Äôt have to provide tracking‚Ä¶ this keeps shipping costs down substantially and nets us more than listing the product for $10.99

What do I mean?
In order to achieve more, you need to have a clearly defined action plan, supported by a set of daily & weekly habits. Without this in place, your goals are nothing more than things you hope to achieve, and I can assure that hope is not a strategy for success.
Hoping that the train coming towards you on the tracks doesn‚Äôt kill you is not nearly as effective as simply moving out of the way!
In my prior emails, I‚Äôve been talking a great deal about a book called The Slight Edge.
Over the holidays, I mentioned this book to several of my friends and did my best to encourage them to read it.
If you have started to read the book, I‚Äôd love for you to share your biggest take away so far. Do it now, ok? Even if it is only a sentence or two.
In my case, my biggest take away has been that I now think about how to ‚ÄúSlight Edge‚Äù pretty much everything in my life‚Ä¶and as a result, forming important daily habits has become much easier for me.
I now have a habit app on my phone called Productive and each day, I‚Äôm reminded of the following habits:

Read 10 pages of a book
Minimum of 20 minutes of cardio
20 minutes of meditation
Write in my gratitude journal
Take a few moments and consciously think about something specific that I appreciate about my wife and daughter

By starting my day at 5:30, I have plenty of time for all of the above and it is a fantastic way to start my day!
As for my action plan, I have my ‚Äúbig rocks‚Äù for the first 90 days of 2020 already committed to writing, supported by a detailed action plan to achieve them. My wife and I then review this plan vs our progress each month so that we can see if we are on track or not.

Here‚Äôs the first‚Ä¶
If you are selling stuff online, you should seriously consider building (and amplifying) a personal brand.
Why?
Authority, credibility, and revenue on demand. (Bright Ideas is the most profitable thing I do)
While I have been building my brand for years, I have not been amplifying it nearly as well as I should have been. In 2020, that is going to change and my income is going to go up. A lot.
How do you amplify?
Ad spend.
More ad spend = more eyeballs = more subscribers = more revenue on demand.
Tomorrow, I‚Äôll dig more into the ways to do this.
For today, my ask is this: please take 2 minutes right now to complete my community feedback survey.

If you don‚Äôt yet have a morning routine that includes meditation, consuming inspirational content, and whatever else you need to get your head in the game, I‚Äôd like to challenge you to start TODAY.
To help you with that, I‚Äôm going to share with you the video that I watched this morning: https://youtu.be/3wi65UW_nJk
This video was created by an African American man who grew up in the projects. His name is William King Hollis and if you think you have any disadvantages that are preventing you from being more successful in business and in life, I suspect hearing his story might help you to put that in perspective.
If you want to be successful in business; pain is necessary. If it wasn‚Äôt, everyone would own a successful company, wouldn‚Äôt they?
The difference between those that do, and those that only talk, is their ability to suffer through the pain.
Want proof? Think about anyone that has ever won a gold medal. Think their training was pain free?
Think about any actor that has hit it big. Think their early years were pain free?
I doubt it.
Pain is necessary. If you want to become financially successful, you have to be 100% committed to that goal; regardless of how much pain you are going to have to endure.
Now go make it happen!
Trent

Today I‚Äôm going to share my next big takeaway from the mastermind I attended last weekend.
As I wrote yesterday, the biggest area that I have dropped the ball in building my personal brand has been to rely solely on organic traffic and not use any advertising.
In 2020, I‚Äôm going to start advertising, and I‚Äôm going to do it in two ways.
Way #1: Facebook retargeting campaigns. Thankfully, I‚Äôve had a Facebook pixel on my site for ages, so my Facebook audience will be pretty big and as retargeting is the cheapest way to advertise online, showing ads to people who have already been to my site will be pretty inexpensive.
Way #2: Running Youtube ads to cold traffic (people who have never been to my site and have no idea who I am). These campaigns will be more costly and I actually did experiment with them a tiny bit in mid 2019.
Being as I want to learn a lot more about running ad campaigns, expect me to publish more interviews with ad experts in the weeks/months ahead.
In fact, I just recorded one with a woman who used to work at both Facebook and Instagram and I‚Äôm working on putting a deal together with her to run my campaigns for me.
When it comes to running ads, you have to lay the right foundation, and a huge part of that foundation is knowing exactly what your audience wants, as well as the language they use to describe it.
That is why I‚Äôm asking you to take 2 minutes to fill out my community feedback survey.

On yesterday‚Äôs eCommerce Fast Track mastermind call, one of our members (Ben) and I talked about some of the things I learned while at the mastermind, and what I‚Äôm about to share with you is particularly applicable to your prospecting for new suppliers.
Why do so many sellers struggle to generate product/supplier leads?
They struggle because lead generation is a level 3 problem and they start doing it before completing the work needed for level 1 and level 2.
What are the first two levels, you ask?
Level 1 is authority and level 2 is positioning.
Think about this for a minute. If I‚Äôm trying to get you to book a call with me to consider partnering up to sell your products on Amazon and I don‚Äôt have any authority/credibility, how likely are you going to be to book a call with me?
Not very likely.
Now considering my positioning (messaging).
If one Amazon seller‚Äôs website messaging is ‚Äúwe sell on Amazon‚Äù and their competitor‚Äôs messaging is ‚Äúwe help brands solve Amazon-related problems‚Äù; which company would be more likely to appeal to a brand?
Obviously, it would be the company that helps brands solve their problems (because there are already far too many sellers that don‚Äôt do anything more than sell the product)
So‚Ä¶does it make sense to you that generating leads would be a lot easier if you have plenty of authority and the right positioning?
Of course it would be easier!

Yesterday, I was down in San Diego for the final day of a 2-day mastermind event filled with other online business owners doing 6-7 figures and the new ideas and growth strategies that I have been exposed to over the last weekend were nothing short of incredible.
I also realized that, much to my disgust, I‚Äôve had a few limiting beliefs preventing me from ramping up my business even faster.
For example; every entrepreneur on planet earth struggles to raise capital; especially in the beginning.
Did you know that there is a way to access capital with a 0% interest?
Did you know that you can use this capital to buy inventory, hire employees, and even buy a business or real estate?
If someone had walked up to me on the street and told me this was possible, I would have laughed at them.
Well guess what? I was wrong, and you can access this capital simply by googling ‚Äúzero interest credit cards‚Äù.
The worst part about limiting beliefs is that we usually don‚Äôt even know if we have them.
To find yours, all you need to do is hang out with people more successful than you, be curious, and ask questions.
Here‚Äôs my question for you today: What is the #1 thing standing in your way right now? Please put your comment below.

We had two people on the call today; Stephane Yelle and a new member by the name of Nick Shucet. Stephane is doing six figures a month in wholesale and Nick is doing six figures a month in RA and wanting to expand into wholesale.
On the call, we talked about:


What is working for Stephane for brand outreach


The sales rep that works for him and how she is paid


How WEBS and Flowster have helped Nick in his RA business


What is wrong with Nick‚Äôs website and how to fix it


The importance of how you position your company when talking to brands


Regarding his website, I gave Nick the following advice: Study Netrush.com and Pattern.com to see the types of content they publish and then do something similar. He needs to write the content himself, and if he doesn‚Äôt know how to build a Wordpress site, he can easily find helpers on Fiverr.com or upwork.com. It will be very inexpensive. The other thing I suggested was that when talking to brands, he needs to position his company as an omni-channel retailer, and the website must support that talking point.

On today‚Äôs eCommerce Fast Track conference call, we talked about some really cool stuff!

You can bet I‚Äôd like to better understand how they are using this data and I‚Äôm planning to dig into it. If you have thoughts on how they are using it, reply in the comments, ok?
After that, we talked at length about the anatomy of a discovery call with a prospective brand. How to start the call, what to say, questions to ask, etc‚Ä¶
Making sure you are scheduling as many of these calls as you can (from the replies you receive) is absolutely critical to your success. If you are new, doing these calls will give you practice‚Ä¶and then once you have been doing them for a while, you will start winning more accounts.
As proof of that, earlier this week, I was speaking with the sales rep who works for a friend‚Äôs Amazon business, and she told me that if she can schedule a call with a brand that says, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want any more Amazon sellers‚Äù, that she can win the account 80-90% of the time. The big lesson here is this: GET ON THE PHONE at every chance you can.
Next, we talked about two new podcast interviews that are going to be published in the next few weeks (http://brightideas.co/273 and http://brightideas.co/274). In these interviews, I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager, why it is important, and how to use it, plus something called attributed revenue.
Why should you care about this stuff? Simple. The more you know about digital marketing, the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands‚Ä¶and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you, if for no other reason than to get access to your brain.
Be smart. Win accounts.

Negotiate pricing.
Decide if there will be a 3 month trial phase or not.
