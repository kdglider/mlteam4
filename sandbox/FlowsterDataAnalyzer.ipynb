The best thing would be to hit the VA hiring websites such as onlinejobs.ph.  Have 3 or so run a task and see which results are the best.

There’s a ton of good VAs out there, but it can sometimes take a bit of time to find them. Mitch’s advice is great.\n","Hi McDavid, message me on facebook https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010499437495 and I can provide you a lead.\n","Jim\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
