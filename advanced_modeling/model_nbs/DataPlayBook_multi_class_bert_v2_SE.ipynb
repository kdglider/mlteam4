The listing was closed the same day. The explanation provided by the initial note from Amazon said that the product “has been identified as … a professional-use only medical device”, which DOES NOT correspond to the product nature, intended use and description. The product was designed for household general use by anyone. This particular product listing went through Amazon’s approval process twice. The last time - early March without any concerns or issues. There is a number of similar products being sold on Amazon at the moment. We even see similar products that are made by the same manufacturer, that we have an agreement with for making ours. The case was opened the same day, as we were notified by Amazon. We provided all requested documents except for FDA certificate, which doesn’t exist and isn’t needed. Instead, the manufacturer has provided a letter confirming that this product does not need FDA approval, as we were asked by the Sellers Support. The big issue for us is that taking into account successful sales during the 6 months, we invested a lot of money into the new manufacturing contract.

I know this to be true because a listing of mine was removed due to this violation.  I have removed all other items that were in violation and removed the audio component and was allowed to relist. Most of the other sellers removed and then went back to selling these hidden cameras with audio capabilities and have begun to hurt my sales. I have reported but they will not do anything anything about it. I asked what would happen if I sell them with audio function and they said that I could be removed and not allow to sell again since I have already been caught… After 4 months, I was told by a seller support lead at captive that I can not do anything but report it. They probably will take anywhere from  months to a year to take care of this matter because it does not affect Amazon on a global scale and that they will not stop because of one seller complaining about competition.

If I had to guess, within 90 days, our revenue will be up over $100K/mo. Here’s a few take aways from my time at the conference over the last few days:  Strong selling brands get pitched far more than you can imagine Some sellers even offer bribes ($10K cash under the table) to get account approval (didn’t work) Everyone’s pitch sounds the same (we’ll help you remove unauthorized sellers and increase sales)  So how do you break through?  Rapport is the key to creating opportunities and winning accounts. If they don’t like/trust you, you have no chance in hell. Content plays a role in building trust. Your smile plays a role in generating rapport. Be persistent. (email & the phone is great for this) Go after brands that aren’t yet on everybody’s radar screen. Look for brands that are the up and comers. DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND KNOW WTF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.  There is a MOUNTAIN of opportunity in wholesale. There is a never ending supply of new brands. You simply have to hustle your ass off to get/keep them, and to do that, you have to want it REALLY BAD. If you aren’t bringing your A-game, don’t bother even trying.

Cheers, David.', \"Hello, This question is directly related to Trent_Dyrsmid  business model (hope Trent or anyone that has a good answer can reply to this). When pitching my company business model to other entrepreneurs, specifically referring to the wholesale model that focus on closing special agreements with brands to have exclusive distribution on Amazon, I always get asked whether what I provide is a service or not. I initially thought it was not but then I realized that working on the same offer but providing it  as a service might be convenient under certain aspects. In the “traditional” wholesale model, my company would first close an agreement for the exclusivity to be the only seller of those products on Amazon, then I would periodically buy the products from the brand and do as much as I can to improve sales because it will benefit me (improve pics, listing and invest in ppc) On the other hand, if I would give the same kind of offer to the brand, but offering it as a service, I would manage their Amazon account (still being the only seller as I would represent the brand itself) but this time I won’t need to purchase any stock in advance (as the brand would provide them), and I will not need to invest in any optimization as it’s their account so I can offer that to them as a service. In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock. I see in the service case (so essentially providing Amazon account management) similar upsides to the “traditional” model (eg. exclusivity) but less downsize (eg. no need to purchase stock in advance) What are your thoughts about this? Am I missing anything? My other biggest concern in the “traditional” model is: how do you make sure that the brand won’t end the exclusivity agreement after you have built BSR for their products and invested in PPC and listing optimization? Or what can you do to minimize that risk?

They’re going to list some items on Amazon, but I don’t think they realize how long it can take to get enough reviews to get their sales flowing. I want to set up automated emails, customize them to the product, and create a PDF to drive their review rate up to 6-7% using Feedback Genius. I haven’t done this with new listings before, so I’m trying to figure out how to discuss this so it’s set up for win-win from the start. I’d also offer to monitor and respond to negative reviews for them. Anywho, I’m thinking of telling them they’ll get a much slower rate of reviews without using automated emails or a PDF, which means if I add those two types of value for them, that will shorten their time to grow sales significantly. And the same with responding to the negative product reviews. So, do I tell them I expect about a .5% review rate without any emails sent, 2% with a custom email sent, and about 6% if we advertise a bonus PDF? And then hold myself accountable for showing them those metrics with Feedback Genius. And if they’re convinced, only after they see that value would I ask them to sign a contract. It’s scary.

In 2020, that is going to change and my income is going to go up. A lot. How do you amplify? Ad spend. More ad spend = more eyeballs = more subscribers = more revenue on demand. Tomorrow, I’ll dig more into the ways to do this. For today, my ask is this: please take 2 minutes right now to complete my community feedback survey 2. Why? Because I’m going to come out with some free training material for you and if you don’t tell me what you want/need, I won’t know what to create. Sound fair? Go fill out the survey 2 now, ok? 3 and next , you ´ ll be doing some research.', 'Today I started my morning like I always do; by watching motivational speeches on Youtube while I’m in the bathroom shaving, brushing my teeth, etc… I like to start my day this way because it fires me up and ensures that when I sit down at my desk, I’m ready to make shit happen! If you don’t yet have a morning routine that includes meditation, consuming inspirational content, and whatever else you need to get your head in the game, I’d like to challenge you to start TODAY. To help you with that, I’m going to share with you the video that I watched this morning: https://youtu.be/3wi65UW_nJk 3 This video was created by an African American man who grew up in the projects. His name is William King Hollis and if you think you have any disadvantages that are preventing you from being more successful in business and in life, I suspect hearing his story might help you to put that in perspective. If you want to be successful in business; pain is necessary. If it wasn’t, everyone would own a successful company, wouldn’t they? The difference between those that do, and those that only talk, is their ability to suffer through the pain. Want proof? Think about anyone that has ever won a gold medal. Think their training was pain free? Think about any actor that has hit it big. Think their early years were pain free? I doubt it. Pain is necessary. If you want to become financially successful, you have to be 100% committed to that goal; regardless of how much pain you are going to have to endure. Now go make it happen! Trent PS. I’m planning to come up with more free training content and need your feedback so I know exactly what I need to create. Please tell me 1 what you need, ok? 2 what need?', 'Today I’m going to share my next big takeaway from the mastermind I attended last weekend. As I wrote yesterday, the biggest area that I have dropped the ball in building my personal brand has been to rely solely on organic traffic and not use any advertising. In 2020, I’m going to start advertising, and I’m going to do it in two ways. Way #1: Facebook retargeting campaigns. Thankfully, I’ve had a Facebook pixel on my site for ages, so my Facebook audience will be pretty big and as retargeting is the cheapest way to advertise online, showing ads to people who have already been to my site will be pretty inexpensive. Way #2: Running Youtube ads to cold traffic (people who have never been to my site and have no idea who I am). These campaigns will be more costly and I actually did experiment with them a tiny bit in mid 2019. Being as I want to learn a lot more about running ad campaigns, expect me to publish more interviews with ad experts in the weeks/months ahead. In fact, I just recorded one with a woman who used to work at both Facebook and Instagram and I’m working on putting a deal together with her to run my campaigns for me. When it comes to running ads, you have to lay the right foundation, and a huge part of that foundation is knowing exactly what your audience wants, as well as the language they use to describe it. That is why I’m asking you to take 2 minutes to fill out my community feedback survey. Why take the time to help me? Because I’m going to help you by coming out with more free training material for you and if you don’t tell me what you want/need, I won’t know what to create. Sound fair?

Why do so many sellers struggle to generate product/supplier leads? They struggle because lead generation is a level 3 problem and they start doing it before completing the work needed for level 1 and level 2. What are the first two levels, you ask? Level 1 is authority and level 2 is positioning. Think about this for a minute. If I’m trying to get you to book a call with me to consider partnering up to sell your products on Amazon and I don’t have any authority/credibility, how likely are you going to be to book a call with me? Not very likely. Now considering my positioning (messaging). If one Amazon seller’s website messaging is “we sell on Amazon” and their competitor’s messaging is “we help brands solve Amazon-related problems”; which company would be more likely to appeal to a brand? Obviously, it would be the company that helps brands solve their problems (because there are already far too many sellers that don’t do anything more than sell the product) So…does it make sense to you that generating leads would be a lot easier if you have plenty of authority and the right positioning? Of course it would be easier! Want to learn more stuff like this from me? Please take a minute to fill out my community feedback survey, ok?

I also realized that, much to my disgust, I’ve had a few limiting beliefs preventing me from ramping up my business even faster. For example; every entrepreneur on planet earth struggles to raise capital; especially in the beginning. Did you know that there is a way to access capital with a 0% interest? Did you know that you can use this capital to buy inventory, hire employees, and even buy a business or real estate? If someone had walked up to me on the street and told me this was possible, I would have laughed at them. Well guess what? I was wrong, and you can access this capital simply by googling “zero interest credit cards”. The worst part about limiting beliefs is that we usually don’t even know if we have them. To find yours, all you need to do is hang out with people more successful than you, be curious, and ask questions. Here’s my question for you today: What is the #1 thing standing in your way right now? Please put your comment below.

He needs to write the content himself, and if he doesn’t know how to build a Wordpress site, he can easily find helpers on Fiverr.com or upwork.com. It will be very inexpensive.

The first item discussed was a Reddit AMA 19 from a $65 million dollar seller by the name of BuyBoxer 3. I haven’t read the entire thread yet, but you can bet I’m going to! One take away was that this company is spending $1,500/mo for Keep a data. You can bet I’d like to better understand how they are using this data and I’m planning to dig into it. If you have thoughts on how they are using it, reply in the comments, ok? After that, we talked at length about the anatomy of a discovery call with a prospective brand. How to start the call, what to say, questions to ask, etc… Making sure you are scheduling as many of these calls as you can (from the replies you receive) is absolutely critical to your success. If you are new, doing these calls will give you practice…and then once you have been doing them for a while, you will start winning more accounts. As proof of that, earlier this week, I was speaking with the sales rep who works for a friend’s Amazon business, and she told me that if she can schedule a call with a brand that says, “we don’t want any more Amazon sellers”, that she can win the account 80-90% of the time. The big lesson here is this: GET ON THE PHONE at every chance you can. Next, we talked about two new podcast interviews that are going to be published in the next few weeks (http://brightideas.co/273 4 and http://brightideas.co/274 3). In these interviews, I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager, why it is important, and how to use it, plus something called attributed revenue. Why should you care about this stuff? Simple. The more you know about digital marketing, the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands…and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you, if for no other reason than to get access to your brain.

When pitching my company business model to other entrepreneurs , specifically referring to the wholesale model that focus on closing special agreements with brands that have exclusive distribution on Amazon , I always get asked whether what I provide is a service or not . I initially thought it was not but then I realized that working on the same offer but providing it  as a service might be convenient under certain aspects . With the � � traditional � � wholesale model , my company would first sign an agreement for the exclus ivity to be the only seller of those goods on Amazon , then I would periodically buy the products from the brand and do as much as I can to improve sales because it will benefit me ( improve pics , listing and invest in pp c ) On that other hand , if I would give the same kind of offer to the brand , but offering it as a service , I would manage their Amazon account ( still being the only seller as I would represent the brand itself ) Only this time I won � � t need to purchase any stock in advance ( as the brand would provide them ), and I will never need to invest in any optimization as it � � s their account so I can offer that to them as a service . In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock . I see in the service case ( so essentially providing Amazon account management ) similar ups ides to the � � traditional � � model ( eg . exclus ivity ) but less down size ( eg . no need to purchase stock in advance ) What are your thoughts about this ? Am I missing anything ? My other biggest concern in the � � traditional wholesale model is : how do you make sure that the brand won � � t end the exclus ivity agreement after you have built B SR for their products and invested in P PC and listing optimization ? Or what can you do to minimize that risk ? Thanks again advance', ' When doing the profit - based model and trying to find your CO GS amount .

I want to set up automated emails , customize them to the product , and create a PDF to drive their review rate up by 6 - 7 % using Input Genius .

I � � d also offer to monitor and respond with negative reviews for them . Any who , I � � m thinking about telling them they can get a much slower rate of reviews either using automated emails or the PDF , which means if I add those two types of value for them , that will shorten their time to grow sales significantly .

So , do I tell them I expect about a . 5 % review rate without any emails sent , 2 % with a custom email sent , and about 6 % if we advertise a bonus PDF ?

Sadly , most of these resolutions ( l ose weight , make more money , find love , etc …) will never become a reality . Why ? Because they are not supported by an action plan that makes achieving these goals the likely outcome . What do I mean ? In order to achieve more , you need to have a clearly defined action plan , supported by a set of individual & weekly habits . Without this in place , your goals are nothing more than things you hope to achieve , and I can assure that hope is not a strategy for success .

As I wrote yesterday , the biggest area that I have dropped the ball in building my personal brand has been to rely solely on organic traffic and not use any advertising . In 2020 , I � � m going to start advertising , and I � � m going to do it in two ways . Way # One Facebook ret arget ing campaigns . Thankfully , I � � ve had my Facebook pixel on my site for years so my Facebook audience will be pretty big and as ret arget ing is the cheapest way to advertise online , showing ads to people who have already been to my site will be pretty inexpensive . Way # 2 : Running Youtube ads to cold traffic ( people who have never been to my site and have no idea who I am ). These campaigns will be more costly and I actually did experiment in them a tiny bit about mid 2019 . Being as I want to learn a lot more about launching ad campaigns , expect me to publish more interviews with ad experts in the weeks / months . In fact , I just recorded one with a woman who used to work at both Facebook and Instagram and I � � m working on putting a deal together with her to run my campaigns for me . When it comes to running ads , you have to lay the right foundation , and a huge part of that foundation is knowing exactly what your audience wants , as well as the language they use to describe it . That is why I � � m asking you to take 2 minutes to fill out my community feedback survey . Why take the time to help me ?

Why do so many sellers struggle to generate product / supp lier leads ? They do because lead generation is their level 3 problem and they start doing it before completing the work needed for level 1 and level 2 . What are the first two levels , you ask ? Level 1 is authority and level 2 is positioning . Think about this for a minute .

Here � � s a summary of what we said  How you get your prospective brands to do video calls instead of phone calls The idea behind � � could be helping � � and how to use it and keep in touch with existing brands How you prepare for a meeting with a brand  Are you struggling to garner new accounts ?

Join the E FT 22 today !', \" On today 's e Commerce Fast Track 13 conference call , we talked about some really interesting stuff ! The first item discussed was a Reddit AMA 19 from a $ 65 million dollar seller by the name of Buy Box er 3 . I haven � � t read the entire thread , but you could bet I � definitely going to ! One take away was that this company is spending $ 1 , 500 / mo for Keep a data . You can bet I � � d like to better understand how they are using this data and I � � m planning to dig into it . If you have thoughts on how they are using it , reply in the comments , ok ? After that , we talked at length about the anatomy of a discovery call with a prospective brand . How to start the call , what to say , questions to ask , etc … Making sure you are scheduling as many of these calls as you can ( from the replies you receive ) is absolutely critical to your success . If you are new , doing the calls will give you practice … and then once you have been doing them probably a while , you will start winning more accounts . As proof of that , earlier this week , I was speaking with the sales rep who works for a friend � � s Amazon business , and she told me that if she can schedule a call with a brand that says , � � we don � � t want any more Amazon sellers � � , that she can win the account 80 - 90 % of the time . The big lesson here is this : GET IN THE PH ONE at every chance you can . Next , we talked about two new podcast interviews that are going to be published in the next few weeks ( http :// bright ide as . co / blog 4 and http :// bright ide as . co / 274 3 ). In these interviews , I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager , if it is important , and how to use it , plus something called attributed revenue . Why should you care about this stuff ? Simple . The more you know about digital marketing , the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands … and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you , if for no other reason than to get access to your brain . Be smart . Win accounts . Have thoughts or comments about this post ? Please reply . Want to get in on the next conference call ?
