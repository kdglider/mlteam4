So  the first step should be to determine whether their distributor(s) will.\nWe know brands who have cut off major distributors because they wouldn\u2019t cooperate. Your brand may have to make some tough decisions.\nIf the distributor will cooperate, they should work with the brand to ensure that all buyers know that products may not be sold on Amazon.\nEither way, Amazon often buys under another name.

If a distributor is cooperating, you are still likely to see people buying products from them and illicitly selling on Amazon.

The questions truly depends on the size of the distributor.  You have distributors that are small and local all the way up to distributors that do 25-100 Billion annually.  Even with that said all distributors are focused on selling product.  Your typical distributor has slim margins, so they want more volume.  The larger distributors the only true value you can add is sales volume.  Unfortunately until your buying big #s that is not a real value prop.   For the smaller distributor you may be able to add value by helping them get sales volume on new items they bring in or slower items they need sales on.

If you listen to any of Trent\u2019s podcasts or watch any of his video\u2019s the key that most people miss when he talks about talking with brands is that he knows he has something the brand needs.  Most people approach brands in the totally opposite mind set.  (ie I need this brand for my business) When you have properly prepared for the call, researched their listings, researched their offline business, know your value proposition, etc you don\u2019t need to sell anything.  Your whole call is about sharing the research that you did on their business.  If a brand does not see your value when you share all this information with them, don;t waste your time \u201cconvincing\u201d them to do anything.

In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock.\nI see in the service case (so essentially providing Amazon account management) similar upsides to the \u201ctraditional\u201d model (eg. exclusivity) but less downsize (eg. no need to purchase stock in advance)\nWhat are your thoughts about this? Am I missing anything?\nMy other biggest concern in the \u201ctraditional\u201d model is: how do you make sure that the brand won\u2019t end the exclusivity agreement after you have built BSR for their products and invested in PPC and listing optimization?\nOr what can you do to minimize that risk?\nThanks in advance", "Other Comments": ["Yes you can absolutely go about it as an account management service.\nThe biggest upside, as you noted, is you don\u2019t have to use a lot of up front capital.\nThe biggest downside is that the brand now sees you as very accountable to provide those services.\nWe\u2019ve found that the accounts where we are sending them checks (buying inventory) are much less headache than when they\u2019re sending us checks (service model).\nWe do ask brands to sign a contract for 6 mo (which auto renews), but the best way to make sure they won\u2019t end the exclusivity agreement is to do great work for them.

I have been on the brand side and on the distribution side in my career.  Being \u201cdistributor\u201d has many different meanings and there are distributors of all different sizes depending on the industry etc.\nIn my experience volume dictates discounts and price not definition.  Typically a distributor gets a better price because they buy in larger volume and sell to other businesses, but with many brand a truck load is a truck load and they will price it the same.  We do not call ourselves a distributor in any way as we do not distribute product to other companies.  Some brands want regional distributors and will then want you to be able to warehouse and sell products to other companies.  This is not a bad model if you\u2019re able to execute it.    At the end of the day if you can purchase significant volume you should be able to negotiate discounts with almost any brand.\nHope that helps", "Hi @Ben Thanks for the input but if you are not a \u201cdistributor\u201d in their system they will not give you the volume you are looking to buy or is that not the case?", "In general I don\u2019t think that is true.

It would be nice to see that in the spreadsheet when you hover over the Heading.\nA fresh perspective from a newbie\nThank You", "Hi Kevin,\nI\u2019m not sure if we have a diagram of just sourcing.  Basically though, you have two options: Leaf Sourcing or Brand Sourcing (Option 1).  Within Leaf Sourcing, we have SOPs to do extractions using PC2 and Tactical Arbitrage (Option 1b).  So you decide whether to Leaf Source or Brand Source and start at step 1 of whichever you choose.  You then proceed through the SOPs numbered by step for whichever direction you chose.  If you chose leaf sourcing and want to use Tactical Arbitrage, you go from Leaf Sourcing Step 1 to Leaf Sourcing Step 2 with Tactical Arbitrage, and then Sourcing Step 3, 4, and lastly 5.\n\nSourcing____Folder____Flowster1544\u00d7602 127 KB\n\nNo matter which direction you choose, you start with the Overview and HubSpot Configuration SOPs.

Thankfully, I\u2019ve had a Facebook pixel on my site for ages, so my Facebook audience will be pretty big and as retargeting is the cheapest way to advertise online, showing ads to people who have already been to my site will be pretty inexpensive.\nWay #2: Running Youtube ads to cold traffic (people who have never been to my site and have no idea who I am). These campaigns will be more costly and I actually did experiment with them a tiny bit in mid 2019.\nBeing as I want to learn a lot more about running ad campaigns, expect me to publish more interviews with ad experts in the weeks/months ahead.\nIn fact, I just recorded one with a woman who used to work at both Facebook and Instagram and I\u2019m working on putting a deal together with her to run my campaigns for me.\nWhen it comes to running ads, you have to lay the right foundation, and a huge part of that foundation is knowing exactly what your audience wants, as well as the language they use to describe it.\nThat is why I\u2019m asking you to take 2 minutes to fill out my community feedback survey.\nWhy take the time to help me? Because I\u2019m going to help you by coming out with more free training material for you and if you don\u2019t tell me what you want/need, I won\u2019t know what to create.\nSound fair?\nGo fill out the survey now, ok?\nTake my survey now: http://brightideas.co/survey 2\nHave a question you\u2019d like me to answer?
