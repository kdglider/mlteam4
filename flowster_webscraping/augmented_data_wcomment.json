The most recent change was to when long term fees begin accruing and the size of the fee.  Inventory for which long term fees are applied was reverted back to anything in storage for more than 365 days.\nLong term fees are calculated based on square footage taken up in the warehouse.  The fee is now $6.90 per cubic foot per unit or $0.15 per unit, whichever is greater.  The minimum fee, $0.15, was dropped from $0.50 per unit which is great for small items.\nLong term fee timelines for items enrolled in the Small & Light Program were not reverted however.  They begin accruing long term fees after 180 days.  Fees from 181-365 days are $0.25 per unit.  After 365 days, they are charge $0.50 per unit.  Be careful with sending too much inventory into the Small and Light Program.

The big lesson here is this: GET ON THE PHONE at every chance you can.\nNext, we talked about two new podcast interviews that are going to be published in the next few weeks (http://brightideas.co/273 4 and http://brightideas.co/274 3). In these interviews, I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager, why it is important, and how to use it, plus something called attributed revenue.\nWhy should you care about this stuff? Simple. The more you know about digital marketing, the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands\u2026and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you, if for no other reason than to get access to your brain.\nBe smart.
