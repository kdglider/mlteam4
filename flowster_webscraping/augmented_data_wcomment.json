The questions truly depends on the size of the distributor.  You have distributors that are small and local all the way up to distributors that do 25-100 Billion annually.  Even with that said all distributors are focused on selling product.  Your typical distributor has slim margins, so they want more volume.  The larger distributors the only true value you can add is sales volume.  Unfortunately until your buying big #s that is not a real value prop.   For the smaller distributor you may be able to add value by helping them get sales volume on new items they bring in or slower items they need sales on.

The whole art of selling it to not sell anything.  Here is what I mean.  If you listen to any of Trent\u2019s podcasts or watch any of his video\u2019s the key that most people miss when he talks about talking with brands is that he knows he has something the brand needs.  Most people approach brands in the totally opposite mind set.  (ie I need this brand for my business) When you have properly prepared for the call, researched their listings, researched their offline business, know your value proposition, etc you don\u2019t need to sell anything.  Your whole call is about sharing the research that you did on their business.  If a brand does not see your value when you share all this information with them, don;t waste your time \u201cconvincing\u201d them to do anything.  Once you convince them to do something once, you will have to continue to \u201cconvince\u201d them again and again and again\u2026", "Likes": "11", "Replies": "10", "Views": "436"}, "Brands with a Single Amazon Seller7": {"Topic Title": "Brands with a Single Amazon Seller", "Category": "Product Sourcing", "Tags": [], "Author": "MattB", "Leading Comment": "@Dennis, great article. \nI remember read this in January.", "Likes": "11", "Replies": "10", "Views": "436"}, "Brands with a Single Amazon Seller8": {"Topic Title": "Brands with a Single Amazon Seller", "Category": "Product Sourcing", "Tags": [], "Author": "MattB", "Leading Comment": "Good point @MattB.

All I am sharing below is based solely on my own personal experience, and professional advice provided to me. I strongly recommending you always seek independent legal and/or financial advice.\nI hope the following helps you better understand the issue so that you can gain a bit more clarity and decide how to move forward.\nI too am non US resident and I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about in this scenario.\nThis is one of the reasons I actually shut down my US single member LLC and established a company in my own country.\nAmazon\u2019s tax interview is setup correctly, and does ask the correct questions from a tax perspective.\nThe issue is however, their system drags across the single member details and uses that same information as the legal entity, thus why your personal name shows up as the legal entity inside of Seller Central.\nI escalated this issue on numerous occasions with Amazon and explained the issue even at their legal level, however, despite also having sought clarification through a US based tax attorney, Amazon still said it is setup correctly in their system.\nThere is no way around it as a single member LLC entity when you\u2019re an international non resident single member.\nThe biggest issue I could foresee with this is that your vendor issued invoices will always be in the name of the legal entity, your LLC, and so this will never match with Amazon\u2019s backend system.\nIf Amazon ever asks for invoices for verification, you\u2019ll very likely hit major issues, an unlikely be able to prove anything.\nOperating under wholesale business model using that legal structure is risky, especially with the level of frivolous IP and authenticity claims that occur on the platform now.\nYou\u2019ll also never be able to get ungated if requested to provide invoices because again, the entity details wont\u2019 match. I know this for sure because I experienced and lost money from it.\nAlso, be aware of the additional reporting requirements that the IRS now has in place for non resident LLCs.\nVery few people are aware of these new requirements until it is too late.\nThere are all very important considerations you should understand when deciding to continue operating as a US entity, and another reason why I would suggest you seek professional advice from someone who specialises in US tax law for NON US residents.\nI hope this helps.\nAll the best.", "Likes": "1", "Replies": "16", "Views": "557"}, "Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC3": {"Topic Title": "Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC", "Category": "Amazon Specific", "Tags": [], "Author": "carlos_federico_igle", "Leading Comment": "Hey there,\nThanks very much for your very detailed reply, really appreciate it.\nYes those issues you mentioned i already came across (invoices with my LLC name) but i got around it by asking them to put my own name and address on it, which they were happy to do but that just sounds amateur to most suppliers i\u2019m sure.\nI\u2019ll be getting in touch with a professional as well as looking into a limited company in my own country.\nI assume you\u2019re operating under your company name in your home country, my i ask if your US suppliers have an issue with this?\nThanks very much again", "Likes": "1", "Replies": "16", "Views": "557"}, "Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC4": {"Topic Title": "Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC", "Category": "Amazon Specific", "Tags": [], "Author": "carlos_federico_igle", "Leading Comment": "Hi,\nI\u2019m glad it helped.\nUnfortunately it\u2019s another one of the many challenges us internationals experience when starting out on the marketplace in the USA.\nYes I established a new company in my home country and then applied for an EIN, which you will need to sell on the marketplace, and yes, it is very easy to get via a phone call to the IRS.\nThen it\u2019s up to you whether you get a reseller certificate.\nYou don\u2019t need one, however you will find a LOT of brand owners who won\u2019t open an account unless you provide them with one, even when you clearly explain that you\u2019re an entity domiciled outside of the USA so legally don\u2019t need one as I was advised by a tax attorney.\nIt\u2019s more to remove that as an objection, but it does come with compliance requirements.\nOnce again, decide which way is right for you once you speak with a professional.\nHope this helps.", "Likes": "1", "Replies": "16", "Views": "557"}, "Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC5": {"Topic Title": "Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC", "Category": "Amazon Specific", "Tags": [], "Author": "carlos_federico_igle", "Leading Comment": "Hi,\nI\u2019ll be investigating your way of doing things this weekend.\nThis information is a massive help, and once again, it\u2019s hugely appreciated!\nWish you all the best with your business\nP.S Anyone following this i\u2019ll update it if i have anything new to report about this issue", "Likes": "1", "Replies": "16", "Views": "557"}, "Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC6": {"Topic Title": "Tax interview for non US citizen with US LLC", "Category": "Amazon Specific", "Tags": [], "Author": "carlos_federico_igle", "Leading Comment": "Hi AnthonyD.\nVery useful advice, thanks for sharing.\nAre you able to share the details of the accountant you use please?

In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock.\nI see in the service case (so essentially providing Amazon account management) similar upsides to the \u201ctraditional\u201d model (eg. exclusivity) but less downsize (eg. no need to purchase stock in advance)\nWhat are your thoughts about this? Am I missing anything?\nMy other biggest concern in the \u201ctraditional\u201d model is: how do you make sure that the brand won\u2019t end the exclusivity agreement after you have built BSR for their products and invested in PPC and listing optimization?\nOr what can you do to minimize that risk?\nThanks in advance", "Likes": "6", "Replies": "3", "Views": "216"}, "Wholesale VS Agency business model?2": {"Topic Title": "Wholesale VS Agency business model?", "Category": "Amazon Specific", "Tags": ["All Other Amazon Related Issues"], "Author": "Mitch", "Leading Comment": "Yes you can absolutely go about it as an account management service.\nThe biggest upside, as you noted, is you don\u2019t have to use a lot of up front capital.\nThe biggest downside is that the brand now sees you as very accountable to provide those services.\nWe\u2019ve found that the accounts where we are sending them checks (buying inventory) are much less headache than when they\u2019re sending us checks (service model).\nWe do ask brands to sign a contract for 6 mo (which auto renews), but the best way to make sure they won\u2019t end the exclusivity agreement is to do great work for them.

Basically though, you have two options: Leaf Sourcing or Brand Sourcing (Option 1).  Within Leaf Sourcing, we have SOPs to do extractions using PC2 and Tactical Arbitrage (Option 1b).  So you decide whether to Leaf Source or Brand Source and start at step 1 of whichever you choose.  You then proceed through the SOPs numbered by step for whichever direction you chose.  If you chose leaf sourcing and want to use Tactical Arbitrage, you go from Leaf Sourcing Step 1 to Leaf Sourcing Step 2 with Tactical Arbitrage, and then Sourcing Step 3, 4, and lastly 5.\n\nSourcing____Folder____Flowster1544\u00d7602 127 KB\n\nNo matter which direction you choose, you start with the Overview and HubSpot Configuration SOPs.

It is in fact easier with one seller because you can trust all of your data more and do not have to coordinate with other sellers on campaigns.\nWhat I am much more concerned about is the opportunity. Are they asking you to invest $60,000 in a product that has never been on Amazon? It sounds like the brand is new to market and they have immediate sales expectations.

If you have thoughts on how they are using it, reply in the comments, ok?\nAfter that, we talked at length about the anatomy of a discovery call with a prospective brand. How to start the call, what to say, questions to ask, etc\u2026\nMaking sure you are scheduling as many of these calls as you can (from the replies you receive) is absolutely critical to your success. If you are new, doing these calls will give you practice\u2026and then once you have been doing them for a while, you will start winning more accounts.\nAs proof of that, earlier this week, I was speaking with the sales rep who works for a friend\u2019s Amazon business, and she told me that if she can schedule a call with a brand that says, \u201cwe don\u2019t want any more Amazon sellers\u201d, that she can win the account 80-90% of the time. The big lesson here is this: GET ON THE PHONE at every chance you can.\nNext, we talked about two new podcast interviews that are going to be published in the next few weeks (http://brightideas.co/273 4 and http://brightideas.co/274 3). In these interviews, I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager, why it is important, and how to use it, plus something called attributed revenue.\nWhy should you care about this stuff? Simple. The more you know about digital marketing, the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands\u2026and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you, if for no other reason than to get access to your brain.\nBe smart.

What ever.\nAnyone have any good strategies other than not selling this product any more?", "Likes": "3", "Replies": "4", "Views": "223"}, "Dealing With Idiots2": {"Topic Title": "Dealing With Idiots", "Category": "Misc Topics", "Tags": [], "Author": "scottschmitz", "Leading Comment": "@Mitch & @LizD Might have some insight into this!", "Likes": "3", "Replies": "4", "Views": "223"}, "Dealing With Idiots3": {"Topic Title": "Dealing With Idiots", "Category": "Misc Topics", "Tags": [], "Author": "scottschmitz", "Leading Comment": "@scottschmitz I don\u2019t think we have ever reached out to sellers to discuss pricing before but sometimes I would certainly like to.  Distributor sourced products are often very price competitive but, if the brand has MAP in place, you may try reaching out directly to them to start a conversation.  It could be a good in to better pricing or marketplace exclusivity.\nIf there is no MAP policy or the brand doesn\u2019t care, you can keep an eye on the seller\u2019s stock and wait for stock outages or quit buying the product.  Distributor products are tough like that as a good money maker can be flipped off by a low I.Q. seller at any time.  Sorry I don\u2019t have any great strategy for this.\nBest,\nMitch", "Likes": "3", "Replies": "4", "Views": "223"}, "Dealing With Idiots4": {"Topic Title": "Dealing With Idiots", "Category": "Misc Topics", "Tags": [], "Author": "scottschmitz", "Leading Comment": "Contacting another seller is a violation of Amazon TOS, so don\u2019t do that.", "Likes": "3", "Replies": "4", "Views": "223"}, "Dealing With Idiots5": {"Topic Title": "Dealing With Idiots", "Category": "Misc Topics", "Tags": [], "Author": "scottschmitz", "Leading Comment": "thank you.", "Likes": "3", "Replies": "4", "Views": "223"}, "Emailing from Hubspot1": {"Topic Title": "Emailing from Hubspot", "Category": "Misc Topics", "Tags": [], "Author": "VonT", "Leading Comment": "It looks like to me when you or your VAs email directly from hubspot it adds @.hubspot-inbox.com after your email address.
