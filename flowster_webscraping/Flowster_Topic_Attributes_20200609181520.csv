So after a month of negotiations with a brand i finally got exclusivity!!!  So brand has huge problem because Amazon is selling their products and they don’t know how is amazon buying their stuff? and of course amazon as a seller is not follow MAP policy and they would like if i can take control of entire brand on Amazon. This brand has a revenue of around 40,000$ a month.
So my question is how can i stop Amazon of selling their products on brands listings?. Because Brand owners doesn’t know where is Amazon buying their products from.
And is there any sample of how exclusivity should look like ?
Hope some one know answer !
Thank you ! ","['Hi @Ivan.  I’m assuming Amazon’s inventory is listed as new and not damaged product?  Does the brand sell through any distributors?', 'Hey @Mitch\nYes it’s listed as new. And yes Brand is selling tru a lot of distributors. And brand doesn’t  know who is selling to amazon…\nSo they wanna give me exclusivity and to force amazon out of listing .', '@Ivan This is going to be a tall task.  A lot of the work will need to be done on the manufacturers end.  Manufacturer needs to be sure that distributors know not to sell their products to online retailers.  It will still happen but it’s easier to get people off the listing if they were told they can’t sell online.\nAlso special labeling can be used for each distribution channel.  A few months after you have applied the labels, buy from Amazon.  Then see what numbers the product has and you’ll know which distribution channel the product came from.\n@LizD may have some other tricks as well.', 'Some distributors will not cooperate with the brands effectively enough to keep Amazon off the listing. So  the first step should be to determine whether their distributor(s) will.\nWe know brands who have cut off major distributors because they wouldn’t cooperate. Your brand may have to make some tough decisions.\nIf the distributor will cooperate, they should work with the brand to ensure that all buyers know that products may not be sold on Amazon.\nEither way, Amazon often buys under another name. Here are a partial list of Amazon brands, but they may buy under other names as well:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17602470011 6](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17602470011&fbclid=IwAR1ADuHuVUsLK9PoifBH74DrlVeChD6vgN4puLGs1mQLkyK9poCWmalcUaw\nMitch has the right idea with the special labeling. If a distributor is cooperating, you are still likely to see people buying products from them and illicitly selling on Amazon. Special labeling (or even marking with a black light pen) will help identify where product is being sourced.\nThere are all sorts of grey market ways Amazon gets their hands on products as well.\nAs for the exclusivity contract, send me an email and I’ll send you a sample template.

Thanks in advance!
Cheers,
David","['The big thing we’ve found distributor sales reps care about is their commission…', 'D.Jin\nMy background is distribution, so hopefully I can give some info.  The questions truly depends on the size of the distributor.  You have distributors that are small and local all the way up to distributors that do 25-100 Billion annually.  Even with that said all distributors are focused on selling product.  Your typical distributor has slim margins, so they want more volume.  The larger distributors the only true value you can add is sales volume.  Unfortunately until your buying big #s that is not a real value prop.   For the smaller distributor you may be able to add value by helping them get sales volume on new items they bring in or slower items they need sales on.  The very very small distributors may need help in other areas, but the med to big ones just want sales in my experience.\nHopefully that helps a bit.', 'Thank you Liz and Ben!', 'Distributors: Care about how deep your pockets are.\nManufacturers: Care about how you will represent their brand and if you will damage the consumers image of the brand.

Got a “we are definitely doing business together. I’m firing 2 of my 4 sellers and adding you as soon as they sell through” from another account that should be worth $50K to $80K/mo in revenue.
I also have at least 10 really solid leads and I expect to win 2-3 of them at a minimum. Another 20 leads that will need nurturing.
If I had to guess, within 90 days, our revenue will be up over $100K/mo.
Here’s a few take aways from my time at the conference over the last few days:

Strong selling brands get pitched far more than you can imagine
Some sellers even offer bribes ($10K cash under the table) to get account approval (didn’t work)
Everyone’s pitch sounds the same (we’ll help you remove unauthorized sellers and increase sales)

So how do you break through?

Rapport is the key to creating opportunities and winning accounts. If they don’t like/trust you, you have no chance in hell.
Content plays a role in building trust. Your smile plays a role in generating rapport.
Be persistent. (email & the phone is great for this)
Go after brands that aren’t yet on everybody’s radar screen. Look for brands that are the up and comers.
DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND KNOW WTF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

There is a MOUNTAIN of opportunity in wholesale. There is a never ending supply of new brands. You simply have to hustle your ass off to get/keep them, and to do that, you have to want it REALLY BAD.

calendly

Gmass
Hubspot

LinkedIn Business
RevSeller
Viral Launch (needed for analyze competitors)
Scope (keyword analysis for value proposition in emails and calls)
If HowMany#? is needed to analyze competitors on Amazon then shouldn’t there be an SOP in the sourcing folder with a task maybe for brand research purposes?
Also it seems like potentially a paid subscription to keepa my not be necessary because (please correct me) Viral Launch will help you identify products sold by Amazon?

The Keepa box is something you’ll naturally just starting peeking at when you open a product page as it is a good source of quick information.  For deep analysis, the data tab of the Keepa box has very useful information such as the 90D Buybox average and 90D average sellers.  If you don’t have a paid account, you can access the data tab about 10 times per month.\nHow many is used to see inventory levels.  If Keepa says the 90D average sellers number is 2 and there are currently 3 sellers but How Many shows they only have 3 items in stock, you can guess with decent certainty that the seller will not remain on the listing.  Still ask the brand about them though.  Both tools I use daily and would recommend trying the free version and moving to paid if you see fit.\nBest,\nMitch', 'Hello Mitch, thank you for explaining!

After my VA sends emails to prospective brands each week, the replies we receive are typically always the usual “we don’t sell to online sellers” or “we have enough sellers”.  Very, very rarely do they even respond with a price list.  (I am guessing this is standard?)

Pull the brand summary report on Viral Launch. This tells me the trend in sales volume and average price. I can also quickly see the top products and how many sellers each have.

If I don’t kill the deal at this stage, my next step is:


Look at the Helium10 product listing score for the top 3-4 products. Ideally, I’m going to find listings with a score under 7/10.


Type in the main keywords from the title of each of the top 3-4 listings to see if ads appear for these keywords. Ideally, no ads appear.


If #2 and #3 are in my favor, I’m DEFINITELY going to call this brand because their marketing sucks and so do their current sellers. They just probably don’t realize that yet and it is my job to help them see the light.

The whole art of selling it to not sell anything.  Here is what I mean.  If you listen to any of Trent’s podcasts or watch any of his video’s the key that most people miss when he talks about talking with brands is that he knows he has something the brand needs.  Most people approach brands in the totally opposite mind set.  (ie I need this brand for my business) When you have properly prepared for the call, researched their listings, researched their offline business, know your value proposition, etc you don’t need to sell anything.  Your whole call is about sharing the research that you did on their business.  If a brand does not see your value when you share all this information with them, don;t waste your time “convincing” them to do anything.  Once you convince them to do something once, you will have to continue to “convince” them again and again and again…', '@Dennis, great article. \nI remember read this in January.', 'Good point @MattB.

I’m a non US citizen with a US LLC. Currently i’m selling under my own name because in the tax interview it says for single member LLCs, put your own personal name.

And if i have a US registered LLC, surely that is a business and US entity that is subject to US taxes?
When i enter “business” rather than “individual” on the form instead and say i’m a US person for tax reasons, it asks what kind of LLC - C-Corp, S-Corp or Partnership, then i can enter my EIN number (My LLC is just a simple single member LLC, no mention of any C-Corp or S-Corp)

98,Wholesale VS Agency business model?,Amazon Specific,['All Other Amazon Related Issues'],Mitch,"['gianmeliShanghai', 'LizD']","Hello,
This question is directly related to @Trent_Dyrsmid  business model (hope Trent or anyone that has a good answer can reply to this).
When pitching my company business model to other entrepreneurs, specifically referring to the wholesale model that focus on closing special agreements with brands to have exclusive distribution on Amazon, I always get asked whether what I provide is a service or not.
I initially thought it was not but then I realized that working on the same offer but providing it  as a service might be convenient under certain aspects.
In the “traditional” wholesale model, my company would first close an agreement for the exclusivity to be the only seller of those products on Amazon, then I would periodically buy the products from the brand and do as much as I can to improve sales because it will benefit me (improve pics, listing and invest in ppc)
On the other hand, if I would give the same kind of offer to the brand, but offering it as a service, I would manage their Amazon account (still being the only seller as I would represent the brand itself) but this time I won’t need to purchase any stock in advance (as the brand would provide them), and I will not need to invest in any optimization as it’s their account so I can offer that to them as a service. In terms of payment then I would just get a commission out of sales but without advancing any stock.
I see in the service case (so essentially providing Amazon account management) similar upsides to the “traditional” model (eg. exclusivity) but less downsize (eg. no need to purchase stock in advance)
What are your thoughts about this? Am I missing anything?
My other biggest concern in the “traditional” model is: how do you make sure that the brand won’t end the exclusivity agreement after you have built BSR for their products and invested in PPC and listing optimization?
Or what can you do to minimize that risk?
Thanks in advance","['Yes you can absolutely go about it as an account management service.\nThe biggest upside, as you noted, is you don’t have to use a lot of up front capital.\nThe biggest downside is that the brand now sees you as very accountable to provide those services.\nWe’ve found that the accounts where we are sending them checks (buying inventory) are much less headache than when they’re sending us checks (service model).\nWe do ask brands to sign a contract for 6 mo (which auto renews), but the best way to make sure they won’t end the exclusivity agreement is to do great work for them. We also try not to expend any more capital (subcontractor, labor, etc) towards growing the account than the profit we make from the account. We’re pretty transparent with the brand about this.', 'Thank you for your answer!\nAdding to that, with your model then, do you only look for big brands with strong presence on Amazon? What about those other small-medium brands that might have weak or no presence on Amazon but might be good brands offline? Do you even consider those as your targets?', '@gianmeliShanghai  Obviously the big brands are the ones that typically make you profitable but we also look to source small brands as well.  You have to be VERY transparent with them about what you will do for them though.  We typically promise them less and on a more elongated timeline.\nYou can tell them, we will do X for you after we have reached Y in gross profit.

100,How to sell a lead on the idea of product reviews = more sales,Amazon Specific,[],dast1983,['LizD'],"Hey -
So I have a lead I want to approach with the idea of creating automated emails using Feedback Genius to increase their product sales. They’re going to list some items on Amazon, but I don’t think they realize how long it can take to get enough reviews to get their sales flowing.
I want to set up automated emails, customize them to the product, and create a PDF to drive their review rate up to 6-7% using Feedback Genius. I haven’t done this with new listings before, so I’m trying to figure out how to discuss this so it’s set up for win-win from the start.
I’d also offer to monitor and respond to negative reviews for them.
Anywho, I’m thinking of telling them they’ll get a much slower rate of reviews without using automated emails or a PDF, which means if I add those two types of value for them, that will shorten their time to grow sales significantly. And the same with responding to the negative product reviews.
So, do I tell them I expect about a .5% review rate without any emails sent, 2% with a custom email sent, and about 6% if we advertise a bonus PDF? And then hold myself accountable for showing them those metrics with Feedback Genius.
And if they’re convinced, only after they see that value would I ask them to sign a contract.
It’s scary. Haven’t done this before. Just know it works.
Interested in your advice,
Dan","['I would caution against promising 6% feedback rate… that’s very high even with a PDF.

Greetings from Amazon Brand Registry Support,
Thank you for contacting us. I am John Daniel and I will be assisting you.
I understand that you would like to add the role of Registered Agent for brand ‘xxxxxxxxxx’ to the account associated with ‘xxxxxxxxx’.
On checking, I see that the email address ‘xxxxxxxxx’ is associated with multiple accounts in our database. Unfortunately, we cannot process role assignment requests for email address that have multiple accounts associated with it.
In order to have access to Brand Registry, we recommend that you create new Brand Registry account using a new email address after which it can be added as a role.

Once the above step is followed and a brand registry account is created, please follow the same procedure as on this case to raise a request of “Updating role or add a new user to account”. This will help us process the role assignment.
Your understanding on this issue are appreciated.
Have a wonderful day!","['@jdsbls0410 There have been several strange stories I’ve heard from sellers using the Brand Registry program of late.

I have been on the brand side and on the distribution side in my career.  Being “distributor” has many different meanings and there are distributors of all different sizes depending on the industry etc.\nIn my experience volume dictates discounts and price not definition.  Typically a distributor gets a better price because they buy in larger volume and sell to other businesses, but with many brand a truck load is a truck load and they will price it the same.

They all add value to the item being purchased and/or drive customer back to Amazon to purchase a like item within the same brand (different flavor, color etc).

Typically No link, no coupon code etc.  From time to time we do a direct call to action with a link (driving back to Amazon), but not always.  Sometimes we do for new item launches etc.   We realize this does not allow us to always track the ROI but believe it is worth the nominal expense.\n\n\nReach out we want to meet you!

The most recent change was to when long term fees begin accruing and the size of the fee.

The fee is now $6.90 per cubic foot per unit or $0.15 per unit, whichever is greater.  The minimum fee, $0.15, was dropped from $0.50 per unit which is great for small items.\nLong term fee timelines for items enrolled in the Small & Light Program were not reverted however.  They begin accruing long term fees after 180 days.  Fees from 181-365 days are $0.25 per unit.  After 365 days, they are charge $0.50 per unit.  Be careful with sending too much inventory into the Small and Light Program.

Get it here:
https://in.flowster.app/marketplace/sop/5cd48dbc22ee975141a128dc 18
What is the point of optimizing your listing and choosing your keywords?
Keywords on Amazon are almost entirely responsibile for your listing traffic. When you have a keyword in your title, description, or bullets you can “rank” for that keyword. This means that when a customer searches for a product using this keyword your Amazon page is more likely to show up in the results.
This is why it is so important to do the proper keyword research and inject these keywords into your listing.
What tools do you need to add the keywords into your listing?
In this process, we are going to show you how to use Cerebro, Magnet2, Frankenstein, and Scribbles to fully optimize your listing.
Overview of the process that this SOP will teach

Collect your ASIN and a root keyword
Use H10’s Cerebro for keyword mining
Use Cerebro to find key phrases
Use H10’s Magnet 2
Collect your possible search terms
Use H10’s Frankenstein to remove duplicate search terms
Use Scribbles to draft your content

There is no reason to have different sellers to cover different regions because Amazon will distribute the product to their warehouses across the country.\nIn addition, the number of sellers selling a brand is not important for marketing. It is in fact easier with one seller because you can trust all of your data more and do not have to coordinate with other sellers on campaigns.\nWhat I am much more concerned about is the opportunity. Are they asking you to invest $60,000 in a product that has never been on Amazon? It sounds like the brand is new to market and they have immediate sales expectations. There should be zero expectations. There can be no guarantee of success with a brand new product.\nIt also sounds like they have money problems which seems like a red flag to me.', 'Thank you for the response Keith,\nYou’re right about the Amazon distribution system if it was FBA. He is talking about FBM in this case. In 2018 there was approximately 37% of amazon users that do not have FBA and were buying FBM. I do not believe having more sellers using FBM in different locations would make too much of a difference, as long as there is the opportunity to buy FBM is there is what really matters in my opinion.\nI have already signed an exclusive contract and they have one product. I was inquiring about a future product that is adding value to the single product of theirs I’m selling now.\nWe’ll have a meeting by the end of August to see where we’re at and how to best improve the sales performance and value of the brand.']",3,178

we always ask if better shipping prices are available


we shop around whenever possible… with our freight broker, with UPS vs FedEx, etc… prices change all the time and if we don’t shop around we’ll miss those changes


if we’re sending parcel shipments, we’ll sometimes repackage in larger boxes - as close to 50 lb as we can get so we don’t run into oversize fees


If we’re selling FBM items on Amazon around the $10 price point, we’ll price them at $9.99 so we don’t have to provide tracking… this keeps shipping costs down substantially and nets us more than listing the product for $10.99

207,Help with LTL,Fulfillment,['Shipping'],Janeen,['D.Jin'],"Hi all!
First time trying to send products into FBA and need help with getting my head around LTL.
I was confused with the LTL process so I reached out to Amazon and they advised steps below.

You (seller) has to provide an FBA Booking Form (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-help/FBABookingForm_US.xls 1)
2.E-mail the form to your carrier along with a link to the User Manual for Carriers. (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/fba-help/User_Manual_for_Carriers.pdf)
3.Your carrier have to create an account by logging into the Carrier Appointment Request Portal to request an appointment. link: https://carriercentral.amazon.com.au/onboarding 1


Do I need to complete steps 1 to 3 or is that what my supplier need to do?
Any help on this will be greatly appreciated.

Sadly, most of these resolutions (lose weight, make more money, find love, etc…) will never become a reality.
Why?
Because they are not supported by an action plan that makes achieving these goals the likely outcome.
What do I mean?
In order to achieve more, you need to have a clearly defined action plan, supported by a set of daily & weekly habits. Without this in place, your goals are nothing more than things you hope to achieve, and I can assure that hope is not a strategy for success.
Hoping that the train coming towards you on the tracks doesn’t kill you is not nearly as effective as simply moving out of the way!
In my prior emails, I’ve been talking a great deal about a book called The Slight Edge.
Over the holidays, I mentioned this book to several of my friends and did my best to encourage them to read it.
If you have started to read the book, I’d love for you to share your biggest take away so far. Do it now, ok? Even if it is only a sentence or two.
In my case, my biggest take away has been that I now think about how to “Slight Edge” pretty much everything in my life…and as a result, forming important daily habits has become much easier for me.
I now have a habit app on my phone called Productive and each day, I’m reminded of the following habits:

Read 10 pages of a book
Minimum of 20 minutes of cardio
20 minutes of meditation
Write in my gratitude journal
Take a few moments and consciously think about something specific that I appreciate about my wife and daughter

By starting my day at 5:30, I have plenty of time for all of the above and it is a fantastic way to start my day!
As for my action plan, I have my “big rocks” for the first 90 days of 2020 already committed to writing, supported by a detailed action plan to achieve them. My wife and I then review this plan vs our progress each month so that we can see if we are on track or not.

229,Takeaway #1 from mastermind,Management,[],gianmeliShanghai,['Trent-Admin'],"While I was at the mastermind weekend I wrote about yesterday, I took about 10 pages of notes that are going to massively boost my income in 2020.
Over the next week or so, I’m going to share some of my biggest takeaways.
Here’s the first…
If you are selling stuff online, you should seriously consider building (and amplifying) a personal brand.
Why?
Authority, credibility, and revenue on demand. (Bright Ideas is the most profitable thing I do)
While I have been building my brand for years, I have not been amplifying it nearly as well as I should have been. In 2020, that is going to change and my income is going to go up. A lot.
How do you amplify?
Ad spend.
More ad spend = more eyeballs = more subscribers = more revenue on demand.
Tomorrow, I’ll dig more into the ways to do this.
For today, my ask is this: please take 2 minutes right now to complete my community feedback survey 2.
Why? Because I’m going to come out with some free training material for you and if you don’t tell me what you want/need, I won’t know what to create.
Sound fair?

I like to start my day this way because it fires me up and ensures that when I sit down at my desk, I’m ready to make shit happen!
If you don’t yet have a morning routine that includes meditation, consuming inspirational content, and whatever else you need to get your head in the game, I’d like to challenge you to start TODAY.
To help you with that, I’m going to share with you the video that I watched this morning: https://youtu.be/3wi65UW_nJk 3
This video was created by an African American man who grew up in the projects. His name is William King Hollis and if you think you have any disadvantages that are preventing you from being more successful in business and in life, I suspect hearing his story might help you to put that in perspective.
If you want to be successful in business; pain is necessary. If it wasn’t, everyone would own a successful company, wouldn’t they?
The difference between those that do, and those that only talk, is their ability to suffer through the pain.
Want proof? Think about anyone that has ever won a gold medal. Think their training was pain free?
Think about any actor that has hit it big. Think their early years were pain free?
I doubt it.
Pain is necessary. If you want to become financially successful, you have to be 100% committed to that goal; regardless of how much pain you are going to have to endure.
Now go make it happen!

231,Takeaway #2 from the Mastermind Weekend,Management,[],Mitch,['Trent-Admin'],"Today I’m going to share my next big takeaway from the mastermind I attended last weekend.
As I wrote yesterday, the biggest area that I have dropped the ball in building my personal brand has been to rely solely on organic traffic and not use any advertising.
In 2020, I’m going to start advertising, and I’m going to do it in two ways.
Way #1: Facebook retargeting campaigns. Thankfully, I’ve had a Facebook pixel on my site for ages, so my Facebook audience will be pretty big and as retargeting is the cheapest way to advertise online, showing ads to people who have already been to my site will be pretty inexpensive.
Way #2: Running Youtube ads to cold traffic (people who have never been to my site and have no idea who I am). These campaigns will be more costly and I actually did experiment with them a tiny bit in mid 2019.
Being as I want to learn a lot more about running ad campaigns, expect me to publish more interviews with ad experts in the weeks/months ahead.
In fact, I just recorded one with a woman who used to work at both Facebook and Instagram and I’m working on putting a deal together with her to run my campaigns for me.
When it comes to running ads, you have to lay the right foundation, and a huge part of that foundation is knowing exactly what your audience wants, as well as the language they use to describe it.
That is why I’m asking you to take 2 minutes to fill out my community feedback survey.

232,How to significantly increase your supplier lead generation,Management,[],Trent-Admin,[],"On yesterday’s eCommerce Fast Track mastermind call, one of our members (Ben) and I talked about some of the things I learned while at the mastermind, and what I’m about to share with you is particularly applicable to your prospecting for new suppliers.
Why do so many sellers struggle to generate product/supplier leads?
They struggle because lead generation is a level 3 problem and they start doing it before completing the work needed for level 1 and level 2.
What are the first two levels, you ask?
Level 1 is authority and level 2 is positioning.
Think about this for a minute. If I’m trying to get you to book a call with me to consider partnering up to sell your products on Amazon and I don’t have any authority/credibility, how likely are you going to be to book a call with me?
Not very likely.
Now considering my positioning (messaging).
If one Amazon seller’s website messaging is “we sell on Amazon” and their competitor’s messaging is “we help brands solve Amazon-related problems”; which company would be more likely to appeal to a brand?
Obviously, it would be the company that helps brands solve their problems (because there are already far too many sellers that don’t do anything more than sell the product)
So…does it make sense to you that generating leads would be a lot easier if you have plenty of authority and the right positioning?

If someone had walked up to me on the street and told me this was possible, I would have laughed at them.
Well guess what? I was wrong, and you can access this capital simply by googling “zero interest credit cards”.
The worst part about limiting beliefs is that we usually don’t even know if we have them.
To find yours, all you need to do is hang out with people more successful than you, be curious, and ask questions.

Stephane is doing six figures a month in wholesale and Nick is doing six figures a month in RA and wanting to expand into wholesale.
On the call, we talked about:


What is working for Stephane for brand outreach


The sales rep that works for him and how she is paid


How WEBS and Flowster have helped Nick in his RA business


What is wrong with Nick’s website and how to fix it


The importance of how you position your company when talking to brands


Regarding his website, I gave Nick the following advice: Study Netrush.com 2 and Pattern.com 6 to see the types of content they publish and then do something similar. He needs to write the content himself, and if he doesn’t know how to build a Wordpress site, he can easily find helpers on Fiverr.com or upwork.com. It will be very inexpensive. The other thing I suggested was that when talking to brands, he needs to position his company as an omni-channel retailer, and the website must support that talking point.

239,Hear from a $65M Seller,Management,['Leadership'],Trent-Admin,[],"On today’s eCommerce Fast Track 13 conference call, we talked about some really cool stuff!
The first item discussed was a Reddit AMA 19 from a $65 million dollar seller by the name of BuyBoxer 3. I haven’t read the entire thread yet, but you can bet I’m going to! One take away was that this company is spending $1,500/mo for Keep a data.
You can bet I’d like to better understand how they are using this data and I’m planning to dig into it. If you have thoughts on how they are using it, reply in the comments, ok?
After that, we talked at length about the anatomy of a discovery call with a prospective brand. How to start the call, what to say, questions to ask, etc…
Making sure you are scheduling as many of these calls as you can (from the replies you receive) is absolutely critical to your success. If you are new, doing these calls will give you practice…and then once you have been doing them for a while, you will start winning more accounts.
As proof of that, earlier this week, I was speaking with the sales rep who works for a friend’s Amazon business, and she told me that if she can schedule a call with a brand that says, “we don’t want any more Amazon sellers”, that she can win the account 80-90% of the time. The big lesson here is this: GET ON THE PHONE at every chance you can.
Next, we talked about two new podcast interviews that are going to be published in the next few weeks (http://brightideas.co/273 4 and http://brightideas.co/274 3). In these interviews, I learned a great deal about Google Tag Manager, why it is important, and how to use it, plus something called attributed revenue.
Why should you care about this stuff? Simple. The more you know about digital marketing, the better off you are when it comes to being able to have intelligent conversations with brands…and the inevitable outcome of your making a very positive first impression on brands is that they will want to do business with you, if for no other reason than to get access to your brain.
Be smart. Win accounts.

The first thing that I know I need to do is create an outline of what we will do and then have a contract signed.  I am thinking of the following.

Register their brand.
Determine how many listings we will optimize.  (I am thinking 5)
Negotiate pricing.
Decide if there will be a 3 month trial phase or not.
Agree that any photos that we take and provide remains our Intellectual property and that if we no longer work together.   They have the option to buy the images from us or delete them from the listing.
Optimize listing.

With Optimizations, you need to make sure that you have time for them to change and to see if your changes are actually increasing your sales.\nFive listings is a lot, and for us, this would be about 10-12 months of work and testing. It is a lot to manage 5 listings at a time.

Since my photo cost is 0.  I am thinking that we will take photo’s but if we ever part ways with the brand that they will need to buy those images from us or take them down.\nWould you have any idea how to value images?  Lets say that the listing sells at $30.00 and sells 200 per month.  That  is about $6000 per month of rev.  I could value an image at $3000.00 as over the year that would be about $72k per sales.\nyour thoughts?', 'Also are there any flows or web pages that you could recommend on what to optimize first?  I do have my game plan but am always looking to improve it.', '@scottschmitz That is great that your image cost is 0! We have never had suppliers pay us for listings, so I wouldn’t know how to value it. If it is not a cost to you, then I think that would be a great value add or “gift or service” for your suppliers.\nIt is up to you if you want to charge them, but personally I think it would be better to either have a flat fee or to offer it as a partner gift. Offering services like this shows that you care about the brand and your long-term relationship with them.\nWEBS has an Optimization template in the Product Listing Folder.\nOne thing I would really upsell is optimizing back end keyword optimizations (we use Helium 10 for this —we have a code that we use for 10% off, and we included it in the Free SOP in the Flowster marketplace). It takes very little time to do, especially with H10 or VL, but can make a huge difference. We make sure to mention that front end and back end optimizations are different.']",1,180
